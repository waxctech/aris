Please open an issue in the GitHub issues for this project. See Troubleshooting problems when working with MPS for more information. See Special template ad-tag-include on how this works and how to disable it if you don’t need it. This is a folder that holds temporary files that are created for dynamic diagrams when running in any other mode than UNSAFE. Read more in Temporary folder .asciidoctor appearing in several places. Due to an error of the currently installed plugin version, the upgrade and download from the Marketplace might fail. As a remedy, download the file from the Marketplace manually and install it as described in the installation chapter. This is an automatic reformatting option in the IDE’s settings. Stripping leading spaces should not change your rendered output. See Indent missing when pasting from clipboard for more information. An AsciiDoc recommended practice is to have one sentence per line. See section “Configuring editor” in chapter “Configuring the plugin” on how to enable soft-wrap. The editor shows several validation warnings and errors, for example, for cross-references. This works the best if the IDE opens all files that belong together as a project. See Validation of AsciiDoc files for details. This might happen when a custom shell has been configured and the folder contains a blank. Re-configure via File Settings…​ Tools Terminal Shell path and add quotes around the path and executable. See Running shell commands from the same terminal for more details. The JCEF preview doesn’t support the IDE’s proxy settings prior to IntelliJ 2021.1. Configuring a proxy for JCEF requires an IDE restart. See Proxy issues with the JCEF preview for more information. This might be due to non-US-ASCII characters in folder names. See Error Message Errno ENOENT and no preview for more information. Some diagram types need external helpers to render diagrams in the preview. See Could not render diagrams with external helpers for more information. This sometimes happens when using the JavaFX preview on high-resolution displays. See Blurry preview when using JavaFX for more information. This sometimes happens when using Swing preview. This activates when neither JavaFX nor JCEF preview are available. See chapters ‘JCEF Preview’ and ‘JavaFX Preview’ for more information. Some diagram types need helper applications installed locally. Another alternative is to use a cloud-based renderer like Kroki. See Could not render diagrams with external helpers for more information. In order for Kroki to embed diagrams in the PDF, the attribute allow-uri-read needs to be set in the plugin’s configuration. This allows Asciidoctor to retrieve the diagram and embed it in the PDF. Starting with plugin release 0.38.13 the attribute is set automatically once Kroki for diagrams has been enabled and the plugin is running in the default UNSAFE mode. Some SVG diagrams embed HTML to show text or arrows, for example, Mermaid or Diagrams.net. This is not supported by Asciidoctor PDF. See Diagrams embedded in PDFs don’t show properly for more details. Please open an issue in the GitHub issues for this project.

To use this plugin, the user of the plugin needs to have one of the IntelliJ family of IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA, GoLand, WebStorm or PyCharm installed. See below for Android Studio and IntelliJ MPS. All default download packages include the JetBrains Runtime 11, a pre-bundled OpenJDK runtime environment. Please use the pre-bundled JetBrains Runtime to run the IDE as it proves to be the most stable. Up to and including IntelliJ IDEA 2020.1 the pre-bundled OpenJDK includes JavaFX, which is required for a rich preview in 2020.1 and earlier. From IntelliJ 2020.2 onward the plugin supports the JCEF browser preview that is pre-bundled in the JetBrains runtime that pre-bundled with 2020.2 and later. It uses an embedded Chrome browser with up-to-date JavaScript and CSS handling. Starting with IDEA 2020.2, the JavaFX preview is only available after installing the plugin “JavaFX for plugins”. If you’ve already installed the IDE and the plugin, continue to section Features of the IntelliJ AsciiDoc plugin. If you have the IDE installed already, continue to the next section Installing the plugin. If you are looking for a free version of the IDE, choose IntelliJ IDEA Community edition. All other IDEs require a paid subscription. You can still download them and use them with a free, time-limited evaluation subscription. You can download them from the JetBrains homepage: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/ If you use Android Studio, go ahead and install the plugin. Afterwards: For Android Studio 4.0+, enable the JavaFX preview by upgrading the bundled JDK. For Android Studio 4.2+, enable the JCEF preview by upgrading the bundled JDK. If you use MPS, go ahead and install the plugin. Support will be limited as MPS doesn’t have all the APIs the plugin can hook into. Have a look at Troubleshooting problems when working with MPS. Please open an issue on GitHub if you want to contribute to making MPS support better. To use the JavaFX preview instead of the Swing preview, you’ll need to run IntelliJ with 64bit Java and JavaFX installed. Starting with IntelliJ 2020.3, the JetBrains platform requires JDK 11 to run. Oracle JDK installations include JavaFX, but can make the IDE unstable and crash. OpenJDK included in a Linux distribution usually doesn’t include JavaFX. The event more advanced JCEF preview will only work with JetBrains OpenJDK runtime. Therefore, JetBrains OpenJDK pre-bundled with your IDE is recommended. Read more about choosing the JDK version of the IDE in the JetBrains knowledge base entry “Selecting the JDK version the IDE will run under”.

This is part of a decision guide for technical writing environments with Antora and the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ. See the page Decisions around Antora for prerequisites and other decisions. A standard Antora setup reads content only from Git repositories where the content has been committed. At the same time, committing generated content to a Git repository will bloat the size of the repository, and will a lot of entries to the Git commit history of that repository. This is even more problematic for attachments, which are bigger in their size. Whenever Antora generates the site, or technical writers clone the repository, all the data in the repository is transferred, which wastes both time and resources. This section describes a scenario when the generated content should be processed by Antora like any other manually written pages. In a similar way, this would also work for images and attachments. This is different from, for example, generated JavaDocs, which won’t be processed with Antora. This is covered in the next section. When committing the content to the regular repository, this makes it simpler for technical writers to reference the content as they need to check out only a single repository. When this content changes frequently, this leads to a cluttered Git history of the repository. Therefore, this option should be chosen only if the generated content is small and doesn’t change frequently. Usually, committing it to a separate repository has advantages, see the section Handling generated non-Antora content for details. When committing generated content to a separate repository, this can could have the following advantages: Technical writers don’t need to check out the latest changes from the generated content when creating their content. This has the assumption that the writer’s content doesn’t link too much with the generated content. The size of the content repository doesn’t grow with the generated content. The repository with the generated content can squash the commits to reduce the size when needed. When doing so, and technical writers eventually check out the content repository, they would need specific instructions how to handle a repository where contents are regularly squashed/force-pushed. The command for this is usually git pull --rebase which would ignore any local changes. Even if the content is in a separate repository, it can still be in the same component as the manually created content, as Antora supports distributed component versions: Both repositories would have in their branches an antora.yml file with the same name and version. At build time, Antora will merge the contents. A page with manually written content can then for example include a generated partial. It might still be helpful for the writer to check out both content repositories in one parent folder as described on the page Using Antora with IntelliJ to have working cross-references between manually created and generated content. Once both repositories have been checked out, generated images show in the preview of the manually created content and attachments can be linked and cross-references can be set. There is the Antora Collector Extension which allows content that is not checked into a Git repository to be used as a source for an Antora generated site. It is currently an early alpha version, it its behavior will change over time as it matures. The Antora Collector Extension can generate content on the fly during the build-process of the site. The script is run once per component that has the extension configured in its descriptor. If the content can’t be generated fast enough to ensure the fast rebuilt of the site, consider the collector as a small wrapper which downloads and unpacks an archive from an artifact repository. That archive can be re-built independently and as needed. This helps the process, especially in scenarios if the generated content is rather static. See Antora Collector Extension on which features are currently supported by the plugin and how to use it. This describes how to add content to an Antora site which doesn’t need to be processed by Antora, such as JavaDoc contents or other API docs. This contents will not have the header, footer and navigation outline that would be present on all Antora pages as it is not processed by Antora. Antora creates its contents in folder specified in the Antora playbook as the ui.output_dir property. Once the Antora run is complete, add the folders with their contents to the folder. The following setup helps technical writers by providing working links to the API docs in all environments. Reference the API folder in the Antora content with an attribute: This the link:{apidocs}[link to the API docs]. To make it work for the production build, define the attribute in the Antora site playbook with and absolute path /path/to/apidocs. To make it work for the author’s build preview, define the attribute in the Antora author’s playbook the full URL like https://example.com/path/to/apidocs so an author can click on it in the locally built site. To make it work in the IDE’s preview, define in an .asciidoctorconfig file in the content repository the full URL like https://example.com/path/to/apidocs so an author can click on it in the preview to navigate to the final site. See Provide hints for the preview with .asciidoctorconfig for details on how to do this. At the moment, Antora doesn’t support Git Large File System (LFS for short). There is an open GitLab issue antora/antora#185 that tracks the state of this feature. Once this has been implemented, cloning the site for building or for technical writers wouldn’t need to download all attachments and images. Instead, they would be downloaded “as needed”. While this might work good for images, this might still not be a good solution for large files.","title":"Generated content and attachments in Antora projects","component":"users-guide","version":"","name":"generated-content-in-antora","url":"/users-guide/antora/generated-content-in-antora.html","titles":[{"text":"Why committing attachments and generated content can become a problem","hash":"why-committing-attachments-and-generated-content-can-become-a-problem","id":1},{"text":"Overview for different options","hash":"overview-for-different-options","id":2},{"text":"Handling generated Antora content","hash":"handling-generated-antora-content","id":3},{"text":"Committing generated Antora content in the content repository","hash":"committing-generated-antora-content-in-the-content-repository","id":4},{"text":"Committing generated Antora content to a separate repository","hash":"committing-generated-antora-content-to-a-separate-repository","id":5},{"text":"Capture content using Antora collector","hash":"capture-content-using-antora-collector","id":6},{"text":"Handling generated non-Antora content","hash":"handling-generated-non-antora-content","id":7},{"text":"Adding the content after the Antora run","hash":"adding-the-content-after-the-antora-run","id":8},{"text":"Options that don’t work yet","hash":"options-that-dont-work-yet","id":9},{"text":"Using Git’s Large File System (LFS)","hash":"using-gits-large-file-system-lfs","id":10}]},"8":{"id":8,"text":"How many repositories to use for components and playbooks in when using Antora together with the AsciiDoc Plugin for IntelliJ. This is part of a decision guide for technical writing environments with Antora and the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ. See the page Decisions around Antora for prerequisites and other decisions. The introduction to using Antora with IntelliJ described the setup of using multiple content repositories with Antora components and an additional Git repository for the playbook. This section describes that setup in more details and its alternatives: How many content repositories to have. Where to store the different component versions (in branches or folders in the main branch). Where to store the playbooks. See the following table show the set of combinations: Content Repositories Versions Playbook Repository Multiple repositories In branches Separate repository Single repository In branches Separate repository Single repository In branches Separate branch Single repository In folders In the content repository One of the most outstanding features of Antora is to pull content from multiple repositories and branches and create one consistent site from it where all links work and are checked at build-time. Those different content repositories offer possibilities which can be useful in a specific scenario: Each repository could be maintained by different people with separate responsibilities and permissions. Some repositories could contain generated content, other repositories could contain content created by humans. For content which can be generated on the fly, the Antora Collector extension can help as it allows to use generate the content when building the site which removes the need to store it in a Git repository. Having it separated would ensure that humans don’t interfere with generated content. This comes with the trade-off that it can slow down the generation of the final site. Some repositories could be public and would allow contributors to read and contribute to the site’s source, while others would be private. Still, all combined repositories could be used to create one public site. As an alternative, different playbooks could create different public or private sites with different combinations of the content repositories. While the content repositories change when the content changes, the Antora playbook changes when new components or versions appear, and the UI changes when the user experience changes or the design changes. As they change for different reasons than the content, they should get a different place, therefore, they should get their own repository. Also, there might be different people responsible for the layout of the site and the content published, another indication for an extra repository. There is a cost of changing this later: When combining multiple repositories with the content in branches into a lower number of repositories or a single repository, this is a tedious task as all branches will need to receive the right content. Upon moving the content, the Git history will be cut in the middle: The old history will stay in the old repository, and won’t be moved. With so many repositories, there are some tradeoffs: If a user needs to contribute to multiple repositories, they would need to check out all of them one by one. If this is the case for a lot of users, this might indicate that repositories should be consolidated to fewer repositories, but it would require that the components in one repository follow the same versioning scheme, as tags and branches in repositories should match the versions of the components. To build an author’s preview, all repositories would need to be checked out, as it would expect all repositories to be available locally. As an alternative, different author’s playbooks could be offered which use some local repositories and some remote repositories. In a scenario where the components are very independent and have only a few links between them, an author could simplify the setup as follows if they skip the build with the author’s playbook and rely on the IDE’s features for validation and preview. See Author preview in the IDE below. The upcoming scenarios attempt to remedy these tradeoffs at the cost of limiting the possibilities described in this paragraph which might not be needed in all situations. In this scenario, all components are stored in one Git repository. Antora supports placing them in different folders, so different responsibilities can be mapped to different folders. Antora supports multiple start paths in the same repository. Placing generated content into the single Git repository is not recommended, as it would create lots of history entries which could disturb users. See the information about Antora collector above to generate content on-the-fly. All users can see all content. Permission to change could be managed with GitHub code owners which would handle the approval of pull requests for their content. Users need to check out only a single content repository, and all cross-references between components will work. As content exists in different branches, the repository with the playbook and the UI has only a single main branch. Having those repositories separate helps to have the up-to-date UI in a separate folder while switching the other folder between releases and feature branches. Also, there might be different people responsible for the layout of the site and the content published, another indication for an extra repository. There is a cost of changing this later: When separating a single repository into multiple repositories, this is a tedious task as all branches will need to receive the right content. Upon moving the content, the Git history will be cut in the middle: The old history will stay in the old repository, and won’t be moved. When users check out only the content repository, the following setup might be simplifying it for writers: Duplicate the necessary attributes from the playbook in the .asciidoctorconfig file as described in Provide hints for the preview with .asciidoctorconfig, and Configure the stylesheet for the IDE’s preview as described in Using the site’s CSS in the preview. This setup might be good enough so that the authors don’t need to build a local author’s preview. While this comes with the cost of maintaining the playbook’s attributes in a second place, it might still be a viable alternative. This setup is very similar to the previous setup Single content repositories with Antora components, additional Git repository for the playbook: The user has a parent folder with two folders, one for the content, another for the playbook. To create two worktrees from a single repository, follow these steps: Create the parent folder. Check out the content repository as before into the content folder. Create a second worktree, by issuing a command like the following on the command line in the content folder: git worktree add --track -b / See the Git worktree documentation for details. The branch can be switched independently in each worktree, but no two worktrees must be on the same branch. To set up the branch for the playbook, it should be a detached branch that doesn’t have a common parent with the content branch. Such a setup can help if having a separate repository for the playbook is difficult in an organization. Having a separate detached branch for the playbook is technically well-supported by Git, still it is not a common practice, so it will need an extra effort for the authors to understand the setup. If authors use the IDE for the preview as described in Such a setup can be changed to a setup with a separate playbook repository at any time without losing the Git history of the playbook. In this variant the authors check out only one repository with both the content and the playbook. As the playbook is in the main branch, it is not possible to switch between branches for different actively maintained versions, as the author would then lose the access to the most recent playbook. Such a single-repository-setup is only possible when the different component versions are not stored in different branches, but in different folders in the main branch. Such a setup looks simple at the start. With the growing number of versions, the number of folders will grow and authors might be confused which folder to edit. When the setup is restructured to a component versions in branches, the history would be cut-off. When maintaining multiple versions, files in different folders need to change. If the versions would be in different branches, the authors could use the Git functionality of cherry-picking changes from one branch to another. Having a separate playbook for an author’s preview will give the best possible preview. Still it has an additional effort for the author: Install node on the machine they are authoring content, or use a pre-packaged setup which utilizes containers with tools like Docker or Podman. Run a local webserver to view the locally generated site. The turnaround time for the site to build locally. With the following steps, the preview in the IDE might be enhanced sufficiently enough to skip the local preview build for the authors. Check out only the one or the few repositories content repositories the authors are interested in. Duplicate the necessary attributes from the playbook in the .asciidoctorconfig file as described in Provide hints for the preview with .asciidoctorconfig. Configure the stylesheet for the IDE’s preview as described in Using the site’s CSS in the preview. While this comes with the cost of maintaining the playbook’s attributes in multiple places, it might still be a viable alternative. When only a single content repository out of many is checked out, links to components in other repositories will not show the page title, can’t be validated in the IDE and can’t be navigated to. This might change in a future version of the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ once Antora Atlas is supported: With the information stored in the site manifest, the local IDE can retrieve the page titles of the pages in other components together with their links to the final site. Follow GitHub issue #1250 for the progress on this issue. It is still a good practice to build a preview for pull requests on the server to see the results for changes before the changes are merged and published to the live site.","title":"Structuring Antora repositories","component":"users-guide","version":"","name":"how-many-repositories","url":"/users-guide/antora/how-many-repositories.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview for different options","hash":"overview-for-different-options","id":1},{"text":"Multiple content repositories with Antora components, additional Git repository for the playbook","hash":"variant-1","id":2},{"text":"Single content repositories with Antora components, additional Git repository for the playbook","hash":"variant-2","id":3},{"text":"Single repository for everything, separate branch for the playbook","hash":"variant-3","id":4},{"text":"Single repository for everything, playbook in the main branch","hash":"variant-4","id":5},{"text":"Author preview in the IDE","hash":"author-preview-in-ide","id":6}]},"9":{"id":9,"text":"Decisions to take when starting with Antora which are difficult to reverse and their trade-offs.

When starting on a new topic, there are some decisions that need to be taken at the beginning and which show their impact only later in the project. So the people involved might want to take the “right” decision. At the same time: The impact might not be known in advance. Future scenarios might be difficult to assess. Some of those decisions might not be easily reversible later in the process. It might not be clear which decisions those would be and what the costs or reversing would be. When talking to IT architects, they call those decisions “architecture decisions”, and they argue to take a structured approach and document assumptions, context, options, people involved and the decisions in an architecture decision record (ADR). When talking to IT consultants, they claim that there is no single “right” decision, and their answer is “it depends”. See Nicolas Fränkel’s blog post on this topic. Still, this page tries to help with better decisions when starting with Antora. Continue for one more section to find out how. This page has been written looking back at the implementation of some Antora sites, and it welcomes feedback from other users to collect more knowledge. It focuses on: Decisions that proved to be difficult to be reversed, so new users should focus on them on their start with Antora. Shows different options and their trade-off in different scenarios and how this changes over time. Provides a practical example which is usually linked to this documentation which also uses Antora. As this guide is part of the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, it takes the perspective of a technical writer managing the content. How many repositories to use for components and playbooks. How to handle generated content in Antora projects. For the future, additional pages might appear here like for example: Which UI bundle to use, and where to place it? Where should an author’s playbook be placed? What should be a component, what a module? Each of the pages in the guide has an “Edit this page” link in the upper right corner. Use this to edit the content on GitHub. As an alternative, all content to this guide is hosted in the Git repository of the AsciiDoc plugin in the doc folder, so it can be edited in an IDE like any other AsciiDoc content. If there are missing features, contact the maintainer via email or create an issue on GitHub. To get a full overview of all features of the plugin, see Features of the IntelliJ AsciiDoc plugin. To customize the plugin’s settings, see Configuring the plugin for recommended settings.","title":"Decisions around Antora","component":"users-guide","version":"","name":"index","url":"/users-guide/antora/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Prerequisites","hash":"prerequisites","id":1},{"text":"Why some decisions are different from others","hash":"why-some-decisions-are-different-from-others","id":2},{"text":"How this page helps with decisions","hash":"how-this-page-helps-with-decisions","id":3},{"text":"Decisions and possible options","hash":"decisions-and-possible-options","id":4},{"text":"Improving this guide","hash":"improving-this-guide","id":5},{"text":"Further reading","hash":"further-reading","id":6}]},"10":{"id":10,"text":"When the characters in the preview look blurry, while the editor shows sharp characters.

The following JetBrains ticket contains examples: IDEA-213110 This only happens when using the JavaFX preview. The current combinations seems to be: Operating System Windows 10, JavaFX preview a high-resolution display with a fractional scaling (for example 125% or 175%), IntelliJ running on OpenJDK 8 / JetBrains Runtime 8 or Operating System Linux (for example Fedora 31 Wayland), JavaFX preview a high-resolution display with scaling-factor 200% or more, IntelliJ running on OpenJDK or JetBrains Runtime (any version) There are four alternatives to fix this: If on IntelliJ 2020.2+: Change to JCEF preview If running on Linux users or running JDK 8: Configure option sun.java2d.uiScale.enabled For Windows users: Reinstall IDE with JetBrains Runtime 11 To change Runtime of existing IDE: Install the ‘Choose Runtime’ plugin This JCEF preview embeds a Chromium based browser in the IDE.

To render diagram previews, 'dot' or other helpers need to be in the path or specified as a document attribute. See this guide how to add or enable Kroki. When adding a diagram to the AsciiDoc file, the preview doesn’t show the diagram, but an error message like: Could not find the 'dot' executable in PATH; add it to the PATH or specify its location using the 'graphvizdot' document attribute When using asciidoctor-diagram, some diagrams will need external helper applications for creating the diagram, like for example, GraphViz. Starting with PlantUML 1.2020.25, PlantUML includes a minimal dot executable for Windows. There is no need to install GraphViz manually anymore. Still, PlantUML will use a locally installed GraphViz version if it finds one. Users should use plugin version 0.32.8 or later for this. Most of the time users can make diagrams work by adding the executable (like GraphViz' dot-executable) to the PATH environment variable. If this doesn’t work for the user, there are other possibilities depending on the diagram type. PlantUML will search for GraphViz using multiple well-known folders and will look for the executable. If an environment variable GRAPHVIZ_DOT exists, it will use the executable stated there. If the error message persists, go to the settings of the AsciiDoc plugin, and add it as an attribute. For the error message above the attribute is graphvizdot. The value is the full path including the executable, for example C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Graphviz2.38\\bin\\dot.exe Users can change the layout engine to Smetana, a port of the dot executable to Java. This can be enabled in the diagram’s source with a pragma prefix: [planutml] ---- @startuml !pragma layout smetana ... @enduml ---- Users find more information about Smetana on the PlantUML homepage. This plugin supports Kroki to render diagrams. Kroki is available as a cloud-based service and as a self-hosted service. See section covering Kroki in the chapter “Diagrams in the preview”. When adding a diagram to the AsciiDoc file, the preview doesn’t show the diagram, but an error message like: PlantUML cannot parse result from dot/GraphViz. This might be due to a locally installed dot executable that is either not compatible with PlantUML, or the executable can’t be started by PlantUML due to restrictions of the operating system (like a virus scanner or execution prevention program). To analyze this further, render the following test diagram in the preview by adding the following snippet to an AsciiDoc document: [plantuml] ---- @startuml testdot @enduml ---- This should render a diagram like the following: Unfortunately, this doesn’t show the dot-executable used for this. To show the executable as well, add a custom property to your IDE via Help Edit custom properties…​: PLANTUML_SECURITY_PROFILE=UNSECURE After adding this property, restart the IDE. The test diagram from above renders the path of the dot executable: This image reports that PlantUML uses an executable from a temporary folder. This the case when PlantUML uses its bundled dot executable on Windows. With this information at hand, users can determine which executable is used, and which executable should be uninstalled or excluded from execution prevention. Running the executable from the command line can provide further information about why execution fails.

Users reported this for diagrams created with Mermaid or Diagrams.net. Other diagram types may be affected as well. While diagrams show nicely in the preview, they don’t show up as expected in the PDF. Looking into the source of the SVG, Mermaid and Diagrams.net use the foreignObject feature to embed HTML for the text inside the SVG. The plugin’s PDF action uses Asciidoctor PDF to create the PDF. Asciidoctor PDF can’t render content in foreignObject as the library prawn-svg doesn’t support it. There are several alternatives to fix this: Change diagram to PNG. Use plugin’s Web-PDF rendering (experimental). Use Asciidoctor Web PDF. When using PNG, unsupported SVG attributes will not cause problems. The tradeoff is usually a larger PDF and a rastered image. Rastered images will not scale and print as good as SVGs. Some diagram types (like Mermaid) don’t support PNG when used, for example, with the Kroki-integration. See Diagrams with Kroki for more information. There is an experimental feature to render the preview as PDF. This feature is work-in-progress, and lacks features like page numbers and a table of contents. See issue #592 for progress. The JCEF Preview needs to be enabled to use this. As this is work-in-progress and experimental, it is behind a feature flag. After enabling the internal mode, users see an action Web PDF in the editor’s toolbar. Clicking on this action creates a PDF from the preview. To create a PDF from SVGs that embed HTML, a browser rendering engine is the preferred way. When the plugin’s Web-PDF rendering isn’t enough, and installing software next to the IDE, consider the Asciidoctor Web PDF project. This requires a local Node installation plus working with package.json and NPM. The result will be command line interface to render AsciiDoc to PDF using an embedded web browser.

As an experimental feature, predefined attributes for character replacements like {plus} or {quot} and attributes are foldable as well. Attributes need to resolve to a single declared value to be folded. Folding is also available for HTML entities (like &) and unicode characters (like †). As an experimental feature, the user needs to enable it in the settings of the plugin. Clicking on a folded attribute unfolds it. The hotkey to unfold one element is Ctrl+NumPad+, the hotkey to fold one element is Shift+NumPad- The hotkey to unfold all elements is Ctrl+Shift+NumPad+, the hotkey to fold all elements is Ctrl+Shift+NumPad-. The structure of the file Alt+7 shows the hierarchy of sections and blocks with titles. This contains (if available) the first block attribute element (like [source], [quote] or [verse]) and the title of the block or section. If an element like an image::[] references another file, it shows the icon and the name of the file. If an include::[] references an AsciiDoc file, it includes the file as a subtree in the structure view. Clicking on either a referenced file or an element of a subtree opens the referenced file. The search all view ShiftShift shows section titles and IDs of blocks. The breadcrumbs-view (bottom of the editor) shows the hierarchy leading to the current sections and blocks. It contains the same elements as in the structure view for the cursor position. AsciiDoc recommends the one-sentence-per-line style. To avoid scrolling horizontally, the user should enable soft-wrap in the IDE. Go to Settings Editor General, scroll to Soft Wrap, add the AsciiDoc file extension (if not already pre-populated) and activate the checkbox “Soft-wrap files”. The user can toggle soft-wrap for a single file via the editor toolbar. If the user hasn’t enabled soft wrap per default, an editor notification appears and suggests enabling soft wrap per default in the IDE settings. Soft wrapping adds an indent on each wrapped line. To disable this, users can set a custom IDEA property via Help Edit Custom Properties. Adding these two properties and restarting the IDE will change the soft wrap arrow to a zero-width space. idea.editor.wrap.soft.before.code=200B idea.editor.wrap.soft.after.code=200B For include::[] and image::[] block macros the keys Ctrl+Click and Ctrl+B navigate to the referenced file. For references (like >) the keys Ctrl+Click and Ctrl+B navigate to the reference (like [[id]]). This works similarly for attributes ({attrib} and :attrib:). “Find Usages” (Alt+F7) finds usages of references and attributes and allows navigation. The user can navigate using Ctrl+Click and Ctrl+B from a file name or Java class name in backticks (as monospaced text like `filename.txt` or `JavaClassName`) or in underscores (as italic text like _filename.txt_ or _JavaClassName_) or asterisks (as bold text like *filename.txt* or *JavaClassName*). The plugin tries to rename occurrences of files and Java classes in the AsciiDoc file when the user renames the file or the class. The user can show a quick documentation for the element at the cursor’s position using Ctrl+Q. At the moments this works for attributes ({attrib} and :attrib:) both in the editor and when using autocomplete. The plugin highlights matching braces including symmetric formatting for bold, italic and monospace. When the user selects some text and types a formatting character like _ or *, the plugin formats selected text by adding the formatting at the beginning and end of the selected text. The plugin uses constrained/unconstrained formatting as necessary. If the selected text already has the chosen formatting, the plugin removes the formatting from the selected text. When the user adds a source code block with information about the language, the plugin will highlight the code block if IntelliJ supports the language. A source block like the following will receive JSON highlighting: [source,json] ---- { \"key\": \"value\" } ---- In the settings the user can enable and disable this feature, including fine-tuning on a per-language level, and if errors should be highlighted or not. The plugin expands the current selection when the user presses Ctrl+W and contracts the current selection when the user presses Ctrl+Shift+W. IntelliJ’s built-in spell checker verifies all text areas of the document. It underlines unknown words with a green wavy line. With the context menu the user can change the spelling or to add the word to the project’s dictionary. To enable spell-checking support for other languages, the user can add a language via File Settings…​ Editor Proofreading. The IDE downloads the dictionaries for the selected languages once the user adds the language in the settings. Starting with IntelliJ 2020.1, the bundled Grazie plugin highlights possible grammar and spelling mistakes in the editor. As of plugin version 0.36.2, every heading and paragraph of the text will be checked. It supports multiple languages: Once the user configured the languages in IDE’s proofreading settings, the plugin detects the language of a section automatically. As it performs all checks locally with the help of libraries from https://languagetool.org/, it doesn’t submit text written in the IDE to a third party cloud service. Starting with IntelliJ 2021.3, there is the Grazie Professional plugin that adds additional grammar checks and auto-completion when writing text using a neural network. All the processing is still running locally in the IDE. There is an optional invitation-only cloud service for additional checks. This additional plugin can add a significant CPU load when writing and committing texts. It allows integration for project specific rules using the Vale syntax to warn about the usage of specific words or phrases. During rendering, Asciidoctor might indicate problems in the file including a line number. The editor shows them as red and yellow annotations. Hover over the annotations to see the full warning or error message. The user can disable this feature in the settings. If it is disabled in the settings, errors show up in the event log. When the text contains Markdown style headings (starting with #) or old style AsciiDoc headings (titles underlined with string or characters matching the length or the heading), the editor highlights this in yellow and offers a quick fix to convert these to a new style AsciiDoc heading. The editor supports a default and dark theme. The user can change the colors of the theme in the IDE settings. When using listings with [source,lang], the plugin triggers language injection to the following code block when the IDE supports the language (either by default, or by a language plugin). This allows syntax highlighting and code completion specific to the language of the code block. The user can disable this feature in the settings completely or for selected languages. For the user to re-format the code block, use “Edit Fragment” (Alt+Enter) and “Reformat Code” (Ctrl+Shift+L). Language injection is disabled if the block contains an AsciiDoc pre-processor macro like include::[], as in these cases the code block with pre-processor macros doesn’t represent compilable code. All comments containing a TODO and FIXME and are indexed in the Todo-View (Alt+6). The user can configure the keywords in the IDE settings. In the editor, the user can select from a list of browsers that are shown in the upper right corner of the editor to preview the document. The user can also trigger this action from the context menu. To update the preview in the browser, the user needs to refresh the contents by pressing F5 in the browser. The user can open an AsciiDoc file in an external tool (like for example, Google Chrome with the Asciidoctor Extension installed). To do this, add Chrome as an external Tool in the settings. Provide $FilePath$ as the argument so that Chrome knows where to find the file. The user can assign a shortcut to the external tool using Help Find action…​ (type the name of external tool) Alt+Enter (type the shortcut of choice) OK. Sometimes a user wants to run the examples in a document. For source code blocks or inline monospace quoted text, the plugin tries to identify executable commands. If it does, it will show a line marker with a green play button at the left of the editor to execute the command in a local shell. The current project needs to be a trusted project. This is available from plugin version 0.37.14 onwards. Currently, the following snippets are available to run: Code Blocks Shell scripts (marked as bash language). Those will be executed in the terminal configured for IntelliJ instance of the user, for example, Bash or PowerShell. All commands run from documents in the same folder share the same terminal. Java and JShell scripts (marked with java or jshell). Those will be executed in a JShell with the project’s default configuration if Java-support is enabled in the IDE. All commands run from one document will share the same JShell instance. Inline Commands All inline commands need to be in backticks and need to show as a monospaced text. The plugin will show the run icon only when it identifies it as a command that is available via the IDE’s Run Anything functionality. All shell commands started from AsciiDoc files in the same directory should open the same terminal tool window as long as the command prompt is currently empty, and no command is currently running in that shell. This functionality might break if a custom shell has been configured and the executable’s folder contains a blank. Re-configure the custom shell via File Settings…​ Tools Terminal Shell path and add quotes (\") around the path and executable for the shell like this: \"D:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe\" The editor has a toolbar with the most common actions like make bold, adding a link, etc. The toolbar hides when entering the presentation mode to remove distractions for the audience. When adding block attributes, the plugin supports statement completion (also known as “Smart Enter”) using the shortcut Shift+Ctrl+Enter. For example: A snippet [source,java receives a closing bracket and two listing separator lines. A snippet include::text.adoc receives an opening bracket, a leveloffset= if it can be derived from the current file’s context and the context of the included file, and a closing bracket. A snippet xref:file.adoc#section will add the section’s title and the brackets. When the user opens a quote or a bracket, the plugin automatically adds a closing quote if it is followed by spaces or a closing bracket. For references, attributes and images, and several macros like include, image and diagrams it provides auto-completion using Ctrl+Space. Both references and attributes support renaming within a project. Typing characters like {, > Use multiple lines to suppress multiple inspections, or separate multiple inspections with commas. Extract and Inline include directives are available to the user. Include directives can be accessed from the “Refactor” context menu and via context-sensitive intentions via Alt+Enter (“Inline Include Directive” and “Extract Include Directive”). Extract directive can take the selected text, current block or the current section including subsections and extract it as a separate document. Inline directive can take the file referenced via the selected include and put its content in the current document; optionally it can provide a preview, inline all occurrences of the file and delete the included file after inlining it. Available from release 0.31.35: The user can change single-line admonition to a block-style admonition. This is available from the “Refactor\"` context menu and as a context-sensitive intention \"`Refactor to block admonition” via Alt+Enter. It is available when user places the cursor on the start of single-line admonition (like for example NOTE:). All of these changes can be undone (Ctrl+Z). Refactorings will re-format the refactored block. See the page about Reformatting Content on how to configure this. The user can disable and enable intentions in Settings…​ Editor Intentions AsciiDoc.","title":"Editing AsciiDoc Content","component":"users-guide","version":"","name":"editor","url":"/users-guide/features/editor.html","titles":[{"text":"Navigation","hash":"navigation","id":1},{"text":"Interaction","hash":"interaction","id":2},{"text":"Running shell commands from the same terminal","hash":"interaction-new-terminal","id":3},{"text":"Writing","hash":"writing","id":4}]},"20":{"id":20,"text":"This is a list of keyboard shortcuts.

By default, the preview is on the right side of a vertical split screen. Using the configuration, the user can change the split to horizontal, and change the position of the preview. The plugin uses AsciidoctorJ 2.x to render the preview. By default, the plugin runs Asciidoctor in mode UNSAFE, which is also the default when a user runs Asciidoctor from the command line. The user can change the behavior to other modes like SAVE, SERVER and SECURE in the plugin’s settings. See section Running Asciidoctor securely in the Asciidoctor User Manual for more information about this feature. When using the JCEF of the JavaFX preview and the safe mode setting SAVE, SERVER or SECURE, remote content is no longer allowed in the preview. With this setting the plugin applies a Content Security Policy to prevent this (new in plugin version 0.32.32). When the user enters formulas using Asciidoctor’s math support, the preview renders them using MathML. If the formula can’t be parsed by MathML, the preview shows an error popup. When the user moves the cursor in the editor, the preview scrolls the text into the preview. When the user clicks on the text in the preview, the editor moves the cursor to the clicked text. This is accurate at block level, unfortunately not yet on the line or the character level. If the content of the preview is part of an included file, the editor opens the included file (new in plugin version 0.32.5). When the user clicks on an external URL, the preview opens it in an external browser. When the user clicks on a relative link within the project (usually a link:[] reference), the preview opens the referenced file in a new editor. When the user right-clicks on an image, the editor shows a dialog to save the file to the local file system. For diagrams like PlantUML, it offers to save the files as PNG or SVG. Windows and Linux users have a dropdown menu for this. MacOS users need to type the extension for the target file name (.svg or .png) The user can zoom in and out of the preview by holding Ctrl and scrolling the mouse wheel up or down. Clicking the middle mouse button whilst holding Ctrl resets the zoom to 100%. The preview can use custom stylesheets.

This assumes that IntelliJ IDEA is open with an either empty project or a project with some existing content. See Opening a project in IntelliJ IDEA on how to do this. This creates a new file in an existing project that can later be edited. To add a file: Right-click on a folder in the project view where the new file should appear. Assuming the user wants to create a file in the root folder empty project “helloworld”, they would click on the bold text “helloworld” (see screenshot below). Choose from the context menu the item New AsciiDoc File. If the menu item for the AsciiDoc file is missing in the steps below, the AsciiDoc plugin wasn’t installed in the prerequisite step. Rectify this by following the steps in Installation via JetBrains Marketplace via the IDE’s settings, then return here to continue. Enter the new file name, and choose either an empty template or the Article template. Press Enter When choosing the article template, and using a file name README.adoc, the result should look similar to the following screenshot. An AsciiDoc recommended practice is to have one sentence per line. This can lead to lines larger than the editor’s width. Using soft wraps will make the content readable in the editor, as each line wraps at the width of the editor. Go to File Settings…​ Editor General Soft Wraps and enable soft wrap for the file extension you use for AsciiDoc files (usually *.adoc). This section describes the most important tool at the borders of the IDE’s window as shown below. The project view is a tree view of all files in the project. Clicking on “Project” hides and shows this view. This is a functionality of all tool windows. The structure view displays the structure of the current AsciiDoc file in the editor. Clicking on “Structure” hides and shows this view. In the editor window, the user can update the text as needed. A toolbar at the top allows formatting of content and toggles the preview. Hover with the mouse over the different icons until a description appears. The preview shows the content from the editor. In the editor, the user can update the content. It has syntax highlighting to improve legibility. On the left of the editor window, small icons allow the user to collapse sections and icons to expand sections. Line numbers help with the orientation. When the IDE suspects a problem, for example, a missing image or a broken reference, it underlines the text with a red line. It uses similar highlighting for suspected spelling and grammar errors. The main things to know about the editor are: When the user types the three letters ad-, the editor suggests live templates for common AsciiDoc structures like lists, links and source code. Continue typing to narrow down the list, use the up and down arrows to highlight an entry, and use Enter to select an entry. See Live Templates for additional information. When typing a file name as part of an image macro or a reference, Ctrl+Space ^ Space shows a list of suggestions. Press Tab to replace the text in editor for the current reference or press Enter to insert the text in the editor. Using Alt+Enter, the user can trigger context-specific features of the IDE, especially when there is an underlined text that indicate warnings and errors. Those features range from creating a missing file to choose a correct word when there is a spelling or grammar mistake. After placing the cursor on an include-macro or a reference and pressing Ctrl+B ⌘ B, the IDE opens that file in a new editor tab. To rename an attribute name, file name or reference, place the cursor on it and press Shift+F6 ⇧ F6, and the IDE renames the reference in all places if the checkboxes are enabled in the dialog that pops up after the key was pressed. To format the complete file or a selection of text, press Ctrl+Alt+L ⌘ ⌥ L. The default configuration removes unnecessary blanks and applies the one-sentence-per line rule. See Reformatting Content for details. To learn more about the editor’s features, read the page Editing AsciiDoc Content. To learn about the shortcuts in the IDE and the editor, read the page Using Hotkeys. Once the user places the cursor in the editor, the preview scrolls so that it shows this paragraph in the preview. The main things to know about the preview are: Clicking on an external link opens it in a new window of the system’s browser. Clicking on an internal link opens the target in the editor. Clicking on text content places the cursor in the editor in that paragraph. If the content is from an included AsciiDoc file, the editor opens that file in a new editor tab.

Windows: 64-bit Windows 8 or newer macOS: macOS Mojave (10.14) or newer Linux: 64-bit x86, glibc 2.17 (Ubuntu 18.04 or newer). The following packages must be present: libfuse2 libxi6 libxrender1 libxtst6 mesa-utils libfontconfig libgtk-3-bin The installation requires an Internet connection to download about 700 MB. See Alternative installation options to install without an Internet connection. This guide will install JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA Community edition, which is free, doesn’t need a subscription and is sufficient for technical writing with the AsciiDoc plugin. See Other IDEs by JetBrains below for more details. To install it, this guide uses the JetBrains Toolbox as it allows a unified approach across all operating systems and an automated update procedure. See Alternative installation options below for alternatives. Follow these steps to install IntelliJ IDEA via the JetBrains Toolbox: Download the Toolbox App from the Toolbox homepage. On Windows and macOS: Start the installation. On Linux: Extract the archive and start the executable. After the installation, the JetBrains Toolbox is started automatically. Users can start it later like any other app from the list of installed applications. Choose the button Install next to the IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition. This will download and install the IDE. The time to install depends on the speed of the internet connection to download approx. 600 MB. After the installation is complete, users can start the installed IDE like any other locally installed application or directly by clicking the IDE in the toolbox. Next step: Continue on page Starting IntelliJ for the first time. The company JetBrains maintains a portfolio of different IDEs with different target audiences. Some of them are free and have “Community” in their name, others need a paid subscription. Students at universities might get a free subscription, and there are trial periods to try out the paid subscriptions. The IntelliJ IDEA Community and IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate editions target Java developers. For Python developers, there is PyCharm Community, PyCharm Edu and PyCharm Ultimate. For web developers, there is WebStorm. For Android developers, there’s Android Studio, which unfortunately requires some additional steps to enable the preview, see JCEF Preview documentation about Android Studio. Users can also download IntelliJ IDEA from the JetBrains as an archive from the download page. This is a good option to install the IDE on a PC which doesn’t have an internet connection. Some Linux distributions contain pre-packaged versions of the IDE, but as those sometimes lack features or components that are required by the AsciiDoc plugin’s preview. Therefore, they are not recommended.

The repository contains several files with kata, with the first one named 01_formatting.adoc. Open the file, and it should show in the editor as seen below: The block between the ==== markings on the left contains the instructions. The same texts shows with a yellow background on the right in the preview. It contains links to the AsciiDoc language documentation which contain information to find a solution for the exercise. Click on the blue links in the preview to open them in the system browser. At the end, indicated with tree dots (...), start typing the solution. Use the preview on the right to verify that the AsciiDoc content entered on the left renders the expected results. After this first exercise, pick other exercises which are relevant to your day-to-day projects. Instead of practicing the AsciiDoc syntax alone, learners can team up with a second person to solve these exercises. There’s also a collaborative web editor which has been designed for such a training. See this blog post for details on how to run such a training event.

See the page Setup for technical writing for an overview of all steps. This assumes that IntelliJ IDEA is open with a project with some existing content. See Opening a project in IntelliJ IDEA and Editing an AsciiDoc file in IntelliJ on how to do this. This section describes how to get from one AsciiDoc document to related documents Use the menu item Navigate for a full list of options, or use Help Find Action…​ to search all action available in the IDE. While all other sections describe how to navigate forward, these are the most common ways to return to files opened previously: To return to a previous file, use Ctrl+E ⌘ E and select the file to return to. Use Alt+Shift+Left Alt+Ctrl+Left ⌘ ⌥ ← and Alt+Shift+Right Alt+Ctrl+Right ⌘ ⌥ → to move backwards and forwards in the latest cursor positions. To return to the previous editing position, use Ctrl+Shift+Backspace ⇧ ⌘ ⌫. Moving the cursor within a file The editor shows the content. After placing the cursor in the editor pane, the user can use the cursor keys to move up, down left and right, use the mouse and the scroll bar to move up and down, and also place the cursor. Use Alt+Up ⌃ ⇧ ↑ and Alt+Down and ⌃ ⇧ ↓ to move the keyboard cursor by paragraph. Use Ctrl+Left ⌥ ← and Ctrl+Right ⌥ → to move the keyboard cursor by one word. Navigation to referenced resource After pressing the Ctrl ⌥, all elements that allow navigation show as underlined when the mouse cursor hovers over them. This works file names and references in macros like xref:[], images:[] and include::[]. When the user clicks the element while the Ctrl ⌥ key is still pressed, the IDE opens the referenced resource in an editor. If there are multiple possible targets, the IDE shows a list of targets for the user to choose the one to navigate to. The same functionality works when placing the editing cursor with the keyboard on such a reference, and pressing Ctrl+B ⌘ B. Finding other usages of an element For each named element like an included file or a reference, the user can find its usages. With the mouse, this is available from the context menu which opens when right-clicking on the element. It is also available as a shortcut via Alt+F7 Alt+Shift+7 ⌥ F7. Jump to a line/column in a file To jump within the current file, press Ctrl+G ⌘ L and enter the line, optionally followed by a colon and the column to where to jump to. To jump to a different file, press Ctrl+Shift+N ⌘ ⇧ O and enter the file name, optionally followed by a colon with the line and optionally followed with a colon with the column. By default, the plugin shows a split view for each AsciiDoc file showing both the editor and the preview. Users can choose to show only the preview or only the editor via the icons in the menu bar or via the plugin’s settings via File Settings…​ Languages & Frameworks AsciiDoc. Once the user places the cursor in the editor, the preview scrolls so that it shows the paragraph where the cursor is placed. Clicking on an external link opens it in a new window of the system’s browser. Clicking on an internal link opens the target in the editor. Clicking on text content places the cursor in the editor in that paragraph. If the content is from an included AsciiDoc file, the editor opens that file in a new editor tab. The structure view is usually hidden. The user opens and hides it by clicking on Structure in the tool border of the IDE’s window in the lower left corner. It always shows the structure of the current editor. Use the icons in front of the structure view to expand and collapse parts of the tree. Click on an item to open the referenced file in the editor and place the cursor on that item. Using the keyboard, the same view is available via Ctrl+F12 ⌘ F12. Users can then use the keyboard to narrow it down to entries containing the typed text. When the current file contains several levels of section headings, there is a hierarchical view of the current levels at the bottom of the editor. Clicking on any of the levels shown there places the cursor on the element named there. The user opens and hides the project view by clicking on Project in the tool border of the IDE’s window. In the upper right corner there are different view variants. For technical writing, the style Project should be used. In the upper right corner is a crosshair icon: Clicking it selects the file that is opened in active editor in the tree view which allows locating a file in the project’s hierarchy. For each file, the user can find its usages, for example, where an AsciiDoc file is used as in an include::[] preprocessor macro. With the mouse, this is available from the context menu which opens when right-clicking on the element. It is also available as a shortcut via Alt+F7 Alt+Shift+7 ⌥ F7. Even when the project tool window is closed, the user can use the navigation bar to navigate the file tree using the current editor’s file path.

A project is usually either a single folder on the local disk, or a remote Git repository. While a project can consist of multiple local folders, this is an advanced case which is possible but not recommended for users new to IntelliJ. This dialog shows the startup screen when IntelliJ is started for the first time. In this dialog, the user has the following options: New Project Choose a name and a local folder where to create the project. For a technical writing project, choose the menu entry Empty Project to avoid creating unnecessary build scripts. Open Choose a folder on the local disk to open it as a project. Usually, this is the root folder of a previously checked-out Git repository. If the project contains a lot of files, it might help to open only a sub-folder with the documentation. Get from VCS Specify a URL with the remote repository and an empty local folder where to check out the files. Once the step is complete, IntelliJ opens the project in the IDE view. Assuming the user chose to create an empty project with the name “helloworld”, the result will look similar to the following. IntelliJ IDEA can open multiple projects concurrently.

This assumes that IntelliJ IDEA is already installed on the PC and a project is open. See Installing IntelliJ for technical writing and Opening a project in IntelliJ IDEA. To set up these features, some proficiency with IntelliJ is beneficial. After the setup is complete and each file has been committed and pushed to the repository, those features will work for all other contributors without additional set-up activities on their side as long as they use IntelliJ and a recent version of the AsciiDoc plugin. Users new to IntelliJ should consider trying out these features with another IntelliJ user. All these recipes describe files that can be committed to the repository. This is why this is called “configuration as code”. After one person has added them to the repository, they’ll be effective for all contributors using IntelliJ once they receive these changes via the repository. When these files change, those changes are effective immediately when the other users receive those changes via the repository. This simplifies onboarding of technical writers, and provides a smooth and similar working experience for every contributor. If technical writers configured their IDE’s AsciiDoc formatting manually, this would be a tedious task and could lead to different configurations in different IDEs. The solution is an .editorconfig file which commits the editor settings to the repository. Most settings are about code formatting. See the EditorConfig homepage to learn more about the concept. Most of the configuration settings work across different editors, while settings starting with ij_ are specific to IntelliJ. Each subfolder can overwrite the settings with its own file. Only the top file must contain root = true. An example .editorconfig file with the default settings # Value \"true\" marks the top configuration file in the project root = true # The following settings match to AsciiDoc content by its filename [{*.ad,*.adoc,*.asciidoc,.asciidoctorconfig}] # Ensure that content is UTF-8 encoded charset = utf-8 # No line should contain trailing whitespace trim_trailing_whitespace = true # Ensure a newline at the end of each file insert_final_newline = true The AsciiDoc plugin support reformatting settings which can be configured via this file as well. See Reformatting Content for details. See the IntelliJ docs about EditorConfig support for further information. When working in a larger project, the content is often broken down in several files which are included in one or more parent documents using include::[] preprocessor macros. This can lead to a situation where the attributes are defined in a parent document, and are not available in the sibling documents. This results in a preview that shows only the attribute names, but not their value, which makes it less useful for technical writers. Also, images might not show in the preview, as the folder for images is not specified. To provide those attributes as a hint for the preview, consider adding an .asciidoctorconfig file. This can be added to any folder of the project, and will be prepended for rendering the preview for all AsciiDoc files in that folder and its subfolders. Other IDEs like Eclipse and VSCode support this file in a similar way, although support may vary. Example .asciidoctorconfig file :myprojectname: Awesome product (1) :experimental: (2) :icons: font :imagesdir: {asciidoctorconfigdir}/images (3) 1 Define a custom attribute. 2 Define attributes that enable Asciidoctor features and rendering. 3 Specify the location of the images.The attribute {asciidoctorconfigdir} points to the folder with the .asciidoctorconfig file, and in this example /images contains all images. After this change, the attribute value {myprojectname} will show as Awesome product, the :experimental setting enables macros like the kbd:[] macro, and images in the sub-folder images will show in the preview. See Asciidoctor Config File for more information. When editing an AsciiDoc file in IntelliJ, the AsciiDoc plugin renders a preview with a default stylesheet. For regular AsciiDoc content, it uses the classic Asciidoctor stylesheet. For Antora content, it uses the default Antora stylesheet. This leads to a situation where the final CSS of the site is different from the preview. To solve this, configure the IDE to use the CSS of the regular website for the plugin’s preview. A minimal setup can add the stylesheet information to a file .asciidoctorconfig in the root folder of the project: Example .asciidoctorconfig to use a public site’s CSS file :linkcss: :stylesdir: https://intellij-asciidoc-plugin.ahus1.de/docs/antora/css/ (1) :stylesheet: preview.css (2) 1 Replace this URL with the site’s URL and path to the CSS file. 2 Replace the file with the preview CSS file. When sites use several CSS files, the recommended approach is to create one CSS file that combines all CSS files for the preview. That file could also include customizations for a good preview, like adjusted borders and workaround for font handling. This file needs to be added by the person maintaining the website. Example CSS customizing the existing stylesheets for the IDE’s preview @import \"site1.css\"; @import \"site2.css\"; /* workaround for browsers that don't allow relative URLs when the page is opened as a file:// */ @font-face { font-family: ... src: url('https://example.com/'); } /* skip the space at the top in the preview where the menu bar is on the production site */ body { padding-top: 0 } See Custom stylesheets for the preview for more information and variants. A repository can contain a special file .idea/externalDependencies.xml to list all required plugins to work with the project. When a users open the repository, IntelliJ prompts to install those plugins. Access the setting via File Settings…​ Build,Execution,Deployment Required Plugins. Use the icons , and to add, remove and edit the required plugins. Once everything is set up, commit the file .idea/externalDependencies.xml to the repository. In most projects, the folder .idea is excluded and none of the files will be committed. To change this for IntelliJ for a Git repository, update the following settings in the .gitignore file which is usually in the root folder of the project. Example .gitignore file to allow committing external dependencies # Ignore everything in the '.idea' folder from the versioning .idea/* # Stil, allow the file 'externalDependencies.xml' in the folder '.idea' !/.idea/externalDependencies.xml For each plugin a minimum and maximum version can be specified. This can encourage collaborators to update to a minimum version if the project requires the latest features or bug fixes of a plugin. Read more in the IntelliJ docs about Required Plugins.

See Installing IntelliJ for technical writing, Opening a project in IntelliJ IDEA and Editing an AsciiDoc file in IntelliJ for details. A user can install additional plugins to add features to the IDE. Each additional plugin will slightly increase the memory usage and startup time of the IDE, so there’s always a small tradeoff. Steps to install a plugin Open the IDE’s setting via File Settings…​. This opens the following menu: Figure 1. Settings menu when installing from JetBrains Marketplace Select Plugins from the settings tree Select Marketplace tab if it is not selected yet Search for a plugin by its name, in this example 'asciidoc'. Click on the button Install. Once the download is complete, press the button Apply and restart the IDE if there is a prompt to do so. Sometimes 3rd party plugin might need some time to be available for the latest version of IntelliJ, so they might prevent a user from upgrading to the latest version of IntelliJ. The plugins listed here are well-maintained and are usually available once a new version of IntelliJ is available. If a plugin should suggested to other contributors to a plugin, consider adding it to the required plugins for the project and checking in that configuration to the repository. See Specifying required plugins for details. In the Terminal tool window, IntelliJ offers a command line interface. A command like ls dir will show a list of files, but to open one of them the user would need to mark the text, copy it to the clipboard and paste it into a search field for search by file via Ctrl+Shift+N ⌘ ⇧ O. To avoid the copy-and-paste of file names and to make the filenames clickable, install the plugin Awesome Console. It will also make URLs in the console clickable. The plugin Grazie already offers spell and grammar checking for several languages, and auto-detect the language of the text. For IntelliJ it is installed by default, so no additional action is necessary for the user. For additional grammar checking, and typing suggestions, there’s the plugin Grazie Professional. As a pre-requisite when running grammar inspections in large projects, increase the memory of the IDE as the IDE might otherwise be slow, or stall due to the lack of memory. Choose menu item Help Change Memory Settings and change this, for example, to 4096 MB. It has built-in styleguides, and can be enhanced by custom Vale rules on a per-project basis. Read more in Checking the Grammar for AsciiDoc content While the Grazie and Grazie Professional plugins support a range of languages, the list is still rather short. At the time of writing this, Czech is, for example, missing. The Hunspell community maintains a lot of freely available dictionaries. The IntelliJ Spellchecker supports Hunspell dictionaries without an additional plugin. Add the spell checker via File Settings Editor Spelling. As of IntelliJ 2022.3, there the Hunspell plugin is no longer needed for Hunspell support. The Czech dictionary in the JetBrains hunspell-dictionaries repo has a broken encoding at the time of writing. Follow JetBrains/hunspell-dictionaries#3 for updates. While IntelliJ includes standard support for Git, this plugin adds additional functionality like: In-editor notification of who is the latest editor of the current line. Status indicator in the lower right corner about changes To add these functionalities, install the GitToolBox plugin. For additional information about the plugin, see the GitToolBox plugin’s manual. At the time of writing, this plugin is free. In the near future, the author plans to offer additional features in a freemium model, meaning that users will need to pay to get functionality that exceeds the current functionality. When a repository contains a ZIP or tar file or another archive format, IntelliJ’s default installation can’t show their contents in the IDE. To access the contents of an archive like a regular folder, install the Archive Browser plugin. The PlantUML project supports different kinds of UML diagrams which can be edited and committed to a repository as plain text. Those diagrams can be rendered in an AsciiDoc file using Asciidoctor Diagram or Kroki, see Diagrams in the preview for more details. To include such a diagram in AsciiDoc content, use an example like this: [plantuml] ---- include::mydiagram.puml[] ---- To edit such a file with the extension .puml with a preview window, install the PlantUML diagram. The diagrams.net project (previously known as draw.io) offers a what-you-see-is-what-you-get graphical editor for diagrams. The files can be stored as XML, SVG or PNG. The special feature of SVGs and PNGs is that they can be displayed in a browser without conversion, yet they are still editable with the diagrams.net editor. To edit such a file in the IDE, install the Diagrams.net plugin. While this plugin is still a very early version, it can support technical writers in managing their content.

This is part of the step-by-step series to set up a technical writing environment with IntelliJ and the AsciiDoc plugin. See the page Setup for technical writing for an overview of all steps. Antora is a static site generator that pulls AsciiDoc content from multiple Git repositories, converts it to HTML, and applies a custom multi-page theme to the output. The result can be hosted on any web server. All content is grouped into components which have a name an optional version identifier. The user of the published site can then choose the component with the version they are interested in, navigate from page to page and use an optional full-text index. This documentation of the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ is maintained in an Antora structure and published using Antora, so it can serve as one possible example what the result can look like. To find out more about Antora, visit the Antora homepage and read the Antora docs. There’s a 20-minute summary about Antora’s concepts plus a demo of IntelliJ in a talk at the conference FOSDEM 2020 by the author of this plugin: Creating a documentation site for users with AsciiDoc and Antora. This page describes how to: Using Antora with one or multiple content repositories with IntelliJ. Enabling navigation between components in different repositories. Configuring the preview to use a stylesheet that makes it look like the published site. This assumes that IntelliJ IDEA is already installed on the PC and a project is open. See Installing IntelliJ for technical writing and Opening a project in IntelliJ IDEA. The following sections assume that the reader knows about the concepts of Antora. Use the links in the previous section to learn about the concepts. For those new to Antora, it would be good practice to start with the Antora Quickstart to try out Antora on the command line before continuing with this page. To set up the playbook repository, basic knowledge of Node and npm is required. If such a setup already exists, such a project can be added to the local IntelliJ development environment without knowledge about Node and npm. With the long list of prerequisites, this is an advanced topic. To set up these features, some proficiency with IntelliJ and the command line is beneficial. After the setup is complete and each file has been committed and pushed to the repository, those features will work for all other contributors with minimal additional setup. Users new to IntelliJ and Antora should consider trying out these features with another IntelliJ user. A standard setup consists of one or more repositories storing content in Antora components plus one repository with an Antora playbook and the theme. The following sections give a high-level overview of these repositories to the extent needed to describe the IntelliJ setup later on this page. They also provide pointers to best practices. Each component has at least an antora.yml file with the name of the component, plus a module folder. The default module is named ROOT. Folder structure of an Antora component 📒 my-content-repo └─📒 docs (1) ├─📄 .asciidoctorconfig (2) └─📒 my-component ├─📄 antora.yml (3) └─📂 modules ├─📂 ROOT │ ├─📂 attachments │ ├─📂 examples │ ├─📂 images │ ├─📂 pages │ │ └─📄 index.adoc (4) │ ├─📂 partials │ └─📄 nav.adoc └─📂 a-named-module └─📂 pages 1 The components can be located in one or more sub-folders in the content repository as defined in the playbook. 2 Configure additional attributes for the preview in the IDE in an .asciidoctorconfig file. See Using the site’s CSS in the preview and Provide hints for the preview with .asciidoctorconfig for details. 3 The antora.yml file is required in the main folder of the component. 4 Each page is a single AsciiDoc file in the pages folder, with index.adoc being the default folder. File names of pages must not start with an underscore (_) or a dot (.), as those characters mark a page as unpublished or hidden. The antora.yml file defines at a minimum the name of the component. Example antora.yml file title: My component name (1) name: my-component version: '1.0' (2) nav: - modules/ROOT/nav.adoc (3) asciidoc: attributes: (4) my-attribute: 'my-value' another-attribute: 'another-value' 1 The title is optional and defaults to the name of the component. 2 The version is optional and can be determined by rules specified in the Antora playbook from the branch or tag name. 3 Zero or more navigation files determine the navigation outline for the component. 4 For each component, attributes can be defined. Site attributes are defined in the Antora playbook which is described in the next section. Some of this can be seen in action in this project’s GitHub repository. This outline lists common files and their purpose in a playbook repository. Depending on the setup, there might be additional files, and some of them might have other names. The following assumes that the version of Antora and its plugins are managed via a package.json file and the npm package manager. Folder structure of an Antora Playbook repository 📒 my-playbook-repo ├─📄 antora-playbook.yml (1) ├─📄 antora-playbook-author.yml (2) ├─📄 package.json (3) ├─📄 package-lock.json (4) ├─📄 ui-bundle.zip (5) ├─📄 README.adoc (6) └─📂 supplemental_ui (7) ├─📂 css │ └─📄 preview.css (8) └─📂 partials ├─📄 footer-content.hbs └─📄 header-content.hbs 1 The antora-playbook.yml or similar file name is required to steer the creation of the production site. 2 The antora-playbook-author.yml or similar file name is optional to provide a pre-configured playbook for an author’s local preview. 3 As Antora is based on Node, a package.json would define the version ranges of Antora and the used plugins. Its scripts section should list the commands to, for example, building the production site, building an author’s local preview and running a minimal local webserver with the author’s local preview. 4 For the packages specified in package.json and their transitive dependencies the npm package manager stores the versions in a separate file package-lock.json. 5 The standard theme for the site can be stored in a ZIP archive in the repository, or in a remote location specified in the playbook. 6 A README.adoc in the root folder of the repository or a similar file is a good practice to describe to users how to build the site for production and for a local preview. 7 A folder supplemental_ui overrides the files in the UI theme. 8 A CSS file for the preview in the IDE is optional, and can be added via the supplemental UI. See Using the site’s CSS in the preview for details. An example playbook file could look as follows: Example antora-playbook.yml file site: title: My example site url: https://example.com (1) start_page: my-component::index.adoc content: sources: - url: https://github.com/example/conent start_paths: - doc/my-component - doc/other-component branches: - 'main' ui: bundle: url: ui-bundle.zip snapshot: true supplemental_files: supplemental_ui output_dir: antora runtime: fetch: true cache_dir: ./.cache/antora log: failure_level: error (2) output: clean: true dir: _site/docs asciidoc: attributes: (3) global-attribute: 'global-value' 1 The 404, site-map, and canonical urls are only generated when am URL is defined. 2 This option ensures that the build-process exits with an error code if, for example, cross-references are broken. This will make a continuous integration build fail, which usually triggers a notification to the technical writer. 3 Global AsciiDoc attributes used across all components. To generate an author’s preview, the file is similar. The only difference is that instead of pointing to a remote Git repository, it points to a local relative URL instead. Example antora-playbook-author.yml file site: # ... content: sources: - url: ../my-content-repo (1) start_paths: - doc/my-component - doc/other-component branches: - 'HEAD' (2) # ... 1 Use a relative path to point to a local checked-out Git repository with the author’s modifications checked out. 2 Instead of specifying a branch or tag, only list HEAD to render the currently checked-out content. Some of this can be seen in action in this project’s GitHub repository for the playbook, although it contains a lot more than this. As described above, the setup contains multiple Git repositories. The recommended setup is to check to create one parent folder and then check out all Git repositories as sub-folders of the newly created folder. Folder structure for playbook and content repositories 📒 parent-folder ├─📒 my-playbook-repo │ ├─📄 antora-playbook.yml │ └─📄 ... ├─📒 my-content-repo │ └─📒 docs │ └─📒 my-component │ ├─📄 antora.yml │ └─📂 modules │ └─📂 ... └─📒 other-content-repo └─📂 ... To render the preview and allow navigation between components, the IDE would need to know about all components, and also the playbook to know about attributes defined there. Depending on how many content repositories exist and how many attributes are defined in the playbook, there are two different setups: Single content repository and only a few AsciiDoc attributes in the playbook This is a simple scenario, and it allows the user to open only the single content repository in IntelliJ. The folder structure described above is still recommended for generating the author’s preview, so that the author’s playbook can use a relative path to the local sandbox of the content repository. When the user opens only the content repository, the IDE doesn’t know about the attributes defined in the Antora playbook. To let the IDE know about the attributes in the playbook and to show a preview similar to the real site, add an .asciidoctorconfig file in the content repository as outlined in Outline of an Antora content repository and duplicate the attributes of the Antora playbook in this file. See Provide hints for the preview with .asciidoctorconfig for more details. If there is more than one content repository, the downside of this approach it that the IDE can’t follow navigation links to components outside the repository. Also, the page titles of those navigation links won’t be rendered in the preview. See the next section on how to avoid this. Multiple content repositories or a lot of AsciiDoc attributes in the playbook To avoid duplicating the attributes from the Antora playbook in multiple content repositories, the content repositories can be opened together with the playbook repository in one project. Here the user opens the parent repository. In this setup, the IDE can read all AsciiDoc attributes from the playbook, and they don’t need to be duplicated in an .asciidoctorconfig file. The IDE also knows about all components, so auto-completion and validation for cross-references work as expected. All page titles for those cross-references are also correctly rendered in the preview. In this scenario, the Git toolbox window shows the history of all Git repositories in the sub-folders of the parent folder. See Multi-module Projects for an alternative setup without a parent folder. The tradeoff: Users might struggle with this approach, and would want to open only a single repository as they usually do. Such a scenario might be where the Antora content is stored side-by-side with source code or other information stored in the repository. If there are only few cross-references between the components, checking out other content repositories is seen as an unnecessary overhead, and checking out the playbook repository is a nuisance. In such a situation, it might be simpler to duplicate the playbook’s attributes in an .asciidoctorconfig file, and authors would rely on the IDE’s preview to prepare their changes. See Author preview in the IDE for details. To use the site’s CSS in the preview, perform two steps: Prepare a preview.css file in the published site. This can be added via the supplemental_ui as described in the Outline of an Antora playbook repository. Reference the preview.css file in the .asciidoctorconfig file as an external CSS file as described in the Outline of an Antora content repository. This can be seen in action for the documentation of this plugin in the preview.css file in the playbook repository and the .asciidoctorconfig file in the content repository. See Custom styling for the preview for details on how to do this.

Tables help technical writers to structure content for their readers. This is part of the step-by-step series to set up a technical writing environment with IntelliJ and the AsciiDoc plugin. See the page Setup for technical writing for an overview of all steps. This assumes that IntelliJ IDEA is open with a project with some existing content. See Opening a project in IntelliJ IDEA and Editing an AsciiDoc file in IntelliJ on how to do this. There are multiple ways to create a AsciiDoc table in IntelliJ. See the following sections for an overview. For large tables, consider the CSV format. Type on the keyboard ad-table and use a live-template to create a table. To find out more about live templates, see the Live Templates page. Use the menu icon for tables () and use the mouse to create a table of the desired size. As above, but select Create Table Dialog…​ to specify the size of the height and width of the table. As above, but select Paste Table…​ to paste a table which has been copied for example from a spreadsheet programm to the clipboard. For this to work usually tab separator works best. Independent of the format the user selects, it is converted to the standard AsciiDoc table when pasted. Use an include to create a table from a CSV file. This is ideals for large, uniform tables. IntelliJ includes CSV file support, see the screenshots at the end of this section. It allows adding and moving rows and columns more efficiently than the standard AsciiDoc format. Therefore, the CSV contents should be included from a separate file and not edited in the AsciiDoc file directly. Such a CSV file can even be edited in a spreadsheet program if required. A table that reads data from a CSV file reads as follows: [%header,format=csv] |=== include::tracks.csv[] |=== When opening the CSV file in IntelliJ for the first time, it will show in a standard editor. To configure the CSV format, click on the table icon in the upper right of the editor. To switch to the table view click on the Data tab at the bottom. See the AsciiDoc manual about tables in CSV, TSV and DSV data format for details what data formats are supported.

It allows combining documentation from multiple repositories into a single website. Each documentation component contains an antora.yml file with a common directory structure with meta information about that component. Users need to upgrade to version 0.30.31 or later of the plugin. Initial support has been added in issue #373. Auto-complete in antora.yml files was implemented starting with plugin version 0.32.54. The plugin will activate Antora support once it finds a file antora.yml and a sub-folder modules. Antora will be active for all AsciiDoc files located in folders below such a file. Once the plugin detects Antora, it activates its Antora features. The plugin detects Antora playbooks by their name. The filename antora-playbook.yml would be detected as an Antora playbook, as well as any other file that ends with .yml and contains both words antora and playbook. For example, antora-playbook-author.yml would be treated as an Antora playbook as well, while antora-localpreview.yml would not be treated as an Antora playbook. Once the plugin detects that a page is part of an Antora module, it uses the Antora CSS theme for the preview (starting with plugin version 0.37.7). The preview will be in light or dark mode as configured in the plugin’s settings. To configure an individual stylesheet from a remote site, users should create an .asciidoctorconfig file like the following in the root or documentation folder of their project: :linkcss: :stylesdir: https://docs.mysite.com/_/css/ :stylesheet: site.css If the remote stylesheet is not available due to an unreachable server or a missing stylesheet, the preview will default to the standard stylesheet. For more information see the chapter Custom stylesheets for the preview for details. When using the Antora xref macro like xref:version@component:module:page.adoc[], the plugin will resolve links to the specific version, component and module with in the current projects. For this it searches all available antora.yml files in the current project. For include::[] macros the plugin supports the Antora families like partial$, example$ and page$. Using Antora page families and includes works in the preview only for trusted project and when IDE is running in the default UNSAFE mode. Otherwise, Asciidoctor will not be able to include files outside the document’s root folder. The plugin validates all references to files within the same component, and also across components. Validation of component and module names requires plugin version 0.37.23 or later. The plugin validates the referenced component and module names. If they don’t exist, it will highlight this as an error in the editor window. If a reference includes a version, the module name is only validated if the version and the component exist within the current project. If they don’t exist, it skips this reference for validation, as the plugin assumes this component to exist in a different branch that isn’t checked out in the current project. For this to work, all components of the Antora site need to be opened in one IntelliJ project. If this isn’t suitable in a given setup, suppress the inspection for a given reference, or disable the inspection in the IDE’s setting for the given project. Example how to disable the inspection for a single reference // suppress inspection \"AsciiDocUnresolvedAntoraModule\" xref:othercomponent:othermodule:index.adoc[] To learn more about how to bundle multiple Git repositories as one IntelliJ project, see the chapter on multi-module projects for details. In the editor, the user can autocomplete filenames and references using Ctrl+Space ^ Space and can navigate to a folder or file using Ctrl+B ⌘ B. To allow auto-completion for components that reside in different Git repositories, consider using a multi-module project. When editing a component descriptor (antora.yml) or playbook (antora-playbook.yml), the plugin provides JSON-Schema support for validation, auto-completion and documentation. Press Ctrl+Q for quick help on each attribute. For the keys nav and start_page in antora.yml, the plugin provides auto-completion. The preview renders images, includes and links. It also resolves reftext and navtitle in the preview (new in Antora 2.3). The user can click on links in the preview that will then open in the editor if they link to a local Antora page. Users can customize the styling of the preview by referencing a stylesheet. See section Using a remote stylesheet for details. The plugin reads all attributes defined in the module’s antora.yml file’s asciidoc.attributes section and uses this for the preview and auto-completion. Starting with release 0.35.2 of the plugin, it also picks up attributes from an Antora playbook if this is within the same project. If the playbook and the components are in different Git repositories, this requires a multi-module project. The plugin sets multiple attributes to allow referencing files with the current Antora module: imagesdir pointing to images of the current module (or assets/images, the Antora pre-2.1 style if that folder exists) partialsdir pointing to partials of the current module (or pages/_partials, the Antora pre-1.1 style if that folder exists) attachmentsdir pointing to attachments of the current module (or assets/attachments, the Antora pre-2.1 style if that folder exists) examplesdir pointing to examples of the current module page-* These and several other intrinsic attributes are supported for the preview like page-component-version, page-module etc. Any of these attributes is set only if the directory exists. While imagesdir and attachmentsdir use a relative path so that they work best with image and link macros, examplesdir and partialsdir use an absolute path that works best with includes macros. This is new in plugin version 0.38.6. Follow asciidoctor/asciidoctor-intellij-plugin#1177 for updates on this feature. The Antora Collector Extension allows content that is not checked into a Git repository to be used as a source for an Antora generated site. The generated content has a higher priority than the checked-in content, so that it overrides and existing content at build-time. When the command generates an antora.yml file in the root folder the scanned directory, those properties overwrite the properties in the component descriptor. From a writer’s point of view, the following features are supported: Attributes and other information from a generated antora.yml file overwrites the component’s antora.yml settings. Generated resources like pages, partials and images are available for auto-completion and validation. Filtering generated contents via the property scan.files is not supported, yet. This table displays which properties are supported by the plugin: Property Supported? Comment run.* no The plugin won’t run the generators. Writers should run them from the command line as and when needed. scan.dir yes The directory with the contents generated by the run command. scan.base yes The folder where the plugin places the contents of the scanned directory. scan.files no At the moment, the plugin will scan files in the scan.dir folder.

This plugin renders the AsciiDoc contents when previewing the documentation. Support for this is available from AsciiDoc Plugin release 0.30.83 for IntelliJ IDEA 2019.3+ and 0.31.9 for IntelliJ IDEA 2020.2+. Starting with AsciiDoc Plugin release 0.31.13, it moved to a separate Asciidoclet Plugin as it prevented the AsciiDoc Plugin to be dynamically installable without a restart. This feature is in its early development and marked “experimental”. Its functionality might change over time. Users need to install the Asciidoclet plugin: Steps Open the IDE’s setting via File Settings…​ Select Plugins from the settings tree Select Marketplace tab if it is not selected yet Search for 'asciidoclet' Click on the Install button. As the Asciidoclet plugin depends on the AsciiDoc plugin, the IDE will ask to install the AsciiDoc plugin as well if it is not already installed. Once the download is complete, restart the IDE After the restart the Quick-Help (Ctrl+Q) will render all Javadoc-comments as AsciiDoc. This is a global setting for all projects. To change the settings, follow these steps: Steps Open the menu File Settings…​ Languages & Frameworks Asciidoclet Check or uncheck the checkbox “Enable Asciidoclet support (AsciiDoc in Javadoc)” Since IDEA release 2020.1 users can choose to show Javadoc comments rendered by the editor. With IDEA release 2020.2 and the latest version of the Asciidoclet Plugin this is supported for Asciidoclet as well. See chapter “Render Javadocs” in the IDEA documentation for more information. Users need to enable this feature in the plugin’s settings: Steps Open the menu File Settings…​ Languages & Frameworks AsciiDoc. Check the checkbox “Enable Asciidoclet support (AsciiDoc in JavaDoc)”. Once this check-box is enabled, the Quick-Help (Ctrl+Q) will render all Javadoc-comments as AsciiDoc. This is a global setting for all projects. Since IDEA release 2020.1 users can choose to show JavaDoc comments rendered by the editor. This is supported with the Asciidoclet plugin from IntelliJ 2020.2 onward only. When working in different projects, there might be AsciiDoc used in some files, but not in others. Libraries might use JavaDoc, some not. As default, the plugin will render all Javadoc contents as AsciiDoc with the following exception: If the Javadoc contents contain an HTML tag the plugin assumes the contents should be rendered as standard Javadoc without the AsciiDoc conversion. When editing Javadoc content, users can open quick docs in a separate window that stays open permanently. It will always show the documentation related to the current at the cursor’s position. When editing the Javadoc contents, the documentation window will show the update Asciidoc rendered version with a short delay. To show the documentation window, choose the menu item View Tool Windows Documentation (sometimes hidden based on the current context at the cursor position) or by pressing Ctrl+Q twice. The default setup of IntelliJ will add the HTML tag on blank lines in Asciidoclet content. This will break the AsciiDoc syntax. This is due to IntelliJ treating Asciidoclet as JavaDoc when reformatting. A minimal recommended setting is to disable adding to empty lines. To disable this, use either IDE’s settings, or use an EditorConfig file. The instructions below describe both approaches. The user can change the settings via File Settings…​ Editor Code Style Java JavaDoc Other and uncheck the option ‘Generate \"\" on empty lines’. The changes are effective once the user confirms the settings via Apply or OK. Figure 1. IntelliJ’s AsciiDoc formatting settings IntelliJ supports the EditorConfig standard to configure re-formatting options on a per-project and per-folder level. Read and find out more about it in the IntelliJ blog. All IntelliJ reformatting options are available in EditorConfig files and are prefixed with ij_. Autocompletion shows all available options. The .editorconfig file affects all project files in its folder and its sub-folders. A file with root = true is usually located in the root folder of the project and indicates the main configuration file. Additional .editorconfig files in a sub-folder can override settings in the file tree they are located in. After creating the file, re-opening the project might be necessary for the IntelliJ settings to take effect. Find an example below. .editorconfig example with AsciiDoclet settings # .editorconfig # see https://editorconfig.org/ for the documentation root = true [*.java] ij_java_doc_add_p_tag_on_empty_lines = false # optional: also preserve all line breaks # ij_java_doc_preserve_line_breaks = true # optional: disable all JavaDoc formatting # ij_java_doc_enable_formatting = false While Asciidoclet supports annotations within Javadoc code snippets, this plugin doesn’t as it breaks parsing of the content. Instead of writing content like this: /** * [source,java] * -- * @SuppressWarnings(\"UnusedDeclaration\") * /\\*...*/ * -- ... Rewrite it like this: /** * [source,java] * -- * {at}SuppressWarnings(\"UnusedDeclaration\") * /\\*...*/ * -- ... Includes will use a path relative to the root of the project. While Asciidoclet allows users to override the path on the command line, the plugin doesn’t allow for in the current version. When viewing rendered Asciidoclet content in the documentation window IDEA supports only a limited amount of CSS styling. One example are section headlines: they all have the same size and font as the regular text. The current version of the plugin doesn’t provide AsciiDoc language injection for the Javadoc content. Therefore, writers miss autocompletion in the editor.

To see the rendered result in the preview, the plugin can use extensions while rendering it. This is an experimental feature starting with version 0.23.0. While it is experimental, names, conventions and functionality may change. Support for AsciidoctorJ extensions is available from 0.31.19. When there are extensions for Asciidoctor used in a command line build, users want to see their effect on the preview rendered within their JetBrains IDE. To find out more about extensions, have a look at the Asciidoctor Extensions Lab or the Asciidoctor Extensions List. The plugin will search the directory .asciidoctor/lib in the root of the project and load all files with the extension “rb” as Asciidoctor extensions and all files with the extension “jar” as AsciidoctorJ extensions. AsciidoctorJ extensions must use the service loader mechanism of AsciidoctorJ to register themselves. If a user doesn’t want to store ruby or JAR files in their code repository, a user may choose to add a download or build-script that populates this folder. Using a configuration file like .gitignore can ensure that the script is checked in to the repository, while the downloaded files are not checked in. The user working with the IDE needs to trust the Ruby or Java code of the extensions, as the code will run with the privileges of the user inside the IDE. When a developer runs a buildscript or other executable content in a repository, executing some else’s code is expected behavior. Running someone else’s code when viewing an Asciidoctor document is unexpected. Therefore, the user needs to confirm to enable Asciidoctor extensions once per project and IDE restart. Extensions run in the same JVM as the IDE. Errors in extensions might consume lots of memory, CPU and might crash the IDE. Changing extensions at runtime re-instantiates the Asciidoctor and JRuby runtime, which will lead to memory leaks.

Use this to optimize the preview when the project contains a document that is split out to multiple include-files. There are usually specific settings for each project that apply to all AsciiDoc sources: these might be the image directory or activating experimental options. While documents have all the settings in the root document, files that it includes will not have these settings when they render in the IDE’s preview. A file called .asciidoctorconfig will contain a snippet that will be pre-pended before rendering the AsciiDoc file. The IntelliJ IDE provides a variable asciidoctorconfigdir that users can use to set base directory variables. Sample content: Example .asciidoctorconfig file :experimental: :icons: font :myprojectbasedir: {asciidoctorconfigdir} The handling will be a mixture of behaviors like .editorconfig and .gitconfig. ifndef/ifdef macros will not work in a file called .asciidoctorconfig as they work only in files that have the extension .adoc. To work around this, rename the file to .asciidoctorconfig.adoc. This will work the same way as .asciidoctorconfig. The internal order of processing is as follows: load the .asciidoctorconfig (or .asciidoctorconfig.adoc) file from the root of the project tree (most general configuration) load the .asciidoctorconfig (or .asciidoctorconfig.adoc) files from the different directories leading to the specific file to be rendered load the .asciidoctorconfig (or .asciidoctorconfig.adoc) file from the current folder where the file to be rendered resides (most specific to the file opened) Prefix each file with :asciidoctorconfigdir: Prepend all the files found in the previous steps to the file to be rendered and render it in the preview. Project specific configuration is possible. Hierarchical configuration is possible. Use the AsciiDoc syntax the user is familiar with (even includes work). The .asciidoctorconfig files are also supported by the Eclipse Asciidoctor Editor. See their wiki page for more information. For Gradle is an asciidoctorEditorConfig task available to create a .asciidoctorconfig via a build-task. See the docs for the 3.2+ release of the asciidoctor-gradle-plugin for more details. While this is currently only supported by the IntelliJ plugin, users can use AsciiDoc’s include syntax to include the .asciidoctorconfig files in the root document and use it to render the document using for example command line tools. // root.adoc include::.asciidoctorconfig[] = My Root Document include::chapter01.adoc[] include::chapter02.adoc[]","title":"Asciidoctor Config File","component":"users-guide","version":"","name":"asciidoctorconfig-file","url":"/users-guide/features/advanced/asciidoctorconfig-file.html","titles":[{"text":"Situation","hash":"situation","id":1},{"text":"Solution","hash":"solution","id":2},{"text":"Behavior","hash":"behavior","id":3},{"text":"Benefits","hash":"benefits","id":4},{"text":"Ecosystem","hash":"ecosystem","id":5},{"text":"Support when using Eclipse as an IDE","hash":"support-when-using-eclipse-as-an-ide","id":6},{"text":"Generating a .asciidoctorconfig file during project build","hash":"generating-a-asciidoctorconfig-file-during-project-build","id":7},{"text":"Using the .asciidoctorconfig file for rendering regular AsciiDoc documents","hash":"using-the-asciidoctorconfig-file-for-rendering-regular-asciidoc-documents","id":8}]},"41":{"id":41,"text":"Define paragraphs in the document that show or hide when the document previewed in the IDE.

The plugin does not use tracking and will not collect statistical information about the users or content they edit. The plugin has been designed in a way that the user can edit content on their local PC, and the preview will be rendered locally as well using an embedded instance of Asciidoctor. If the user changes the Safe mode in the plugin’s settings from UNSAFE to any other mode, the preview in JCEF and JavaFX mode will restrict all content to the local project and will prohibit loading of external content using a content security policy (CSP). Starting with plugin version 0.36.6, all untrusted projects will default to the SECURE mode. The IDE shows a “Safe mode, limited functionality” notification once the user opens an AsciiDoc file. The following list is probably incomplete, but should cover the major points: If the content includes a remote image, the preview will pull that image from the internet and will reveal their IP address. The same applies if they choose to include a remote style sheet for the preview. I am not a lawyer, but usually people consider IP addresses as personal information in the EU. If the user chooses to use the Kroki diagram preview instead of Asciidoctor Diagram, the contents of the diagrams will be transmitted to a Kroki server and rendered there. They can choose to host their own Kroki server. Enabling Kroki also enables the attribute allow-uri-read if the Safe mode is set to UNSAFE. This allows Asciidoctor to read contents from remote locations when converting the AsciiDoc content. In general, users should only edit trusted content in their IDE. If they choose to check out and open an untrusted project, the code of that project might contain malicious snippets as part of the AsciiDoc content and other scripts.

Users can reformat a single AsciiDoc file when placing the cursor in an editor, or folders with all files and subdirectories when selecting a folder in the project’s tree view. The IntelliJ IDEA formatter is available form the command line. It allows both reformatting of files and checking that the formatting of the files correct using the “dry run” option. Currently, reformatting adjusts empty lines around headings, lists, and blocks. It also adjusts spaces around list items. By default, it re-formats blocks to the one-sentence-per-line style. The user can disable this in the code style settings. By default, the IDE will remove leading blanks when pasting content to an AsciiDoc document.

When storing settings in the IDE instance, they are active across projects opened with this IDE. If a user has multiple IDE instances installed on a single machine, each IDE instance will use its own configuration. The XML file is specific to IntelliJ. Depending on the project’s version control system configuration, the folder .idea/codeStyle might be ignored. When using Git as a version control system, users should check their .gitignore file if the folder or its contents are ignored, and amend the configuration to allow files to be committed there. Once the file has been committed, the formatting settings are available to other users as well. The .editorconfig file is an open standard that allows for several configuration options that will be applied across IDEs of different vendors. For some IDEs, an additional plugin might be necessary to support the features. The JetBrains family of IDEs supports the .editorconfig files out of the box. It also allows custom properties starting with ij_. The AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ uses custom properties starting with ij_, therefore, those settings are only effective for IntelliJ. The settings in an .editorconfig file become effective in IntelliJ once the user saves and closes the editor of the file. An example AsciiDoc configuration for the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ in an .editorconfig file looks as follows: An example .editorconfig file with the default settings root = true [{*.ad,*.adoc,*.asciidoc,.asciidoctorconfig}] # Common AsciiDoc settings that work across IDEs charset = utf-8 trim_trailing_whitespace = true insert_final_newline = true # Custom settings for the IntelliJ AsciiDoc plugin ij_asciidoc_blank_lines_after_header = 1 ij_asciidoc_blank_lines_keep_after_header = 1 ij_asciidoc_formatting_enabled = true ij_asciidoc_one_sentence_per_line = true The file with root = true should be placed in the root folder of the project.

The plugin supports the operation::[]-macro of Spring REST Docs in the editor and the preview. This requires version 0.30.6+ of the plugin. Spring REST Docs allow the developer to write API documentation using information recorded in test cases. These ensure that the examples in the documentation work with the current version of the code. When running the tests, Spring REST Docs creates a folder generated-snippets with the recorded examples. The developer can reference these snippets in the documentation. This plugin supports developers when documenting their Spring REST Docs. It provides auto-complete for the editor and renders a preview that shows the documentation content together with the recorded examples of the tests. As the editor support requires the generated-snippets folder to be present, users need to run their tests to create and populate it before the editor support activates. All recoded Spring REST docs tests are located in the folder generated-snippets. This signals the plugin to enable the Spring REST docs functionality. It looks relative to the pom.xml for target/generated-snippets or relative to build.gradle or build.gradle.kts for build/generated-snippets.

This chapter walks the user through the steps to prepare an .asciidoctorconfig file to either replace the stylesheet or to add additional styles to the HTML header. The .asciidoctorconfig file will configure the preview of all AsciiDoc files in the folder where it is located and this folder’s sub-folders. See Asciidoctor Config File for more details. If the configuration references remote content like fonts or stylesheets, these will require an online connection for the preview to load them. Only JCEF and JavaFX preview support proper stylesheets. Swing preview doesn’t support modern CSS, and will therefore not support custom CSS. New with version 0.35.16: If no online connection exists, or the local stylesheet is missing, the preview defaults to the standard stylesheet. This replaces the standard stylesheet with a custom stylesheet. Use local content or link to a remote stylesheet. Create a file .asciidoctorconfig with the following contents: .asciidoctorconfig :stylesdir: {asciidoctorconfigdir}/.asciidoctor (1) :stylesheet: preview-stylesheet.css (2) 1 Point to a directory with the stylesheet. As this uses {asciidoctorconfigdir}, the folder is relative to the .asciidoctorconfig file. 2 Filename of the stylesheet to be used. Place the stylesheet in the .asciidoctor folder: .asciidoctor/preview-stylesheet.css body { /* ... */ } This has been available since the plugin version 0.31.31+. Once the document or the configuration set the linkcss attribute, the preview will link to an external stylesheet and will no longer embed the stylesheet. Apply the following steps: Create a file .asciidoctorconfig with the following contents: .asciidoctorconfig :linkcss: :stylesdir: https://example.com/css :stylesheet: preview-stylesheet.css Host an external stylesheet In the example above, the preview will fetch it from https://example.com/css/preview-stylesheet.css preview-stylesheet.css body { /* ... */ } Due to the current nature of the plugin and browser’s security controls, a stylesheet can’t load fonts with a relative path starting with two dots (..). As a workaround, use an absolute path with protocol and hostname instead. A more complex example that wraps multiple stylesheets of the original site, overwrites fonts with an absolute URL and then adds custom changes for the preview can look like the following: Example CSS customizing the existing stylesheets for the IDE’s preview @import \"site1.css\"; @import \"site2.css\"; /* workaround for browsers that don't allow relative URLs when the page is opened as a file:// */ @font-face { font-family: ... src: url('https://example.com/'); } /* skip the space at the top in the preview where the menu bar is on the production site */ body { padding-top: 0 } The asciidoctor-skins project hosts multiple stylesheets users can link to. The following example uses a dark skin. Fedora theme based on the asciidoctor-skins project :linkcss: :stylesdir: https://darshandsoni.com/asciidoctor-skins/css :stylesheet: fedora.css If the remote stylesheet is not available due to an unreachable server or a missing stylesheet, the preview will default to the standard stylesheet. Starting with release 0.37.52 of the plugin, the preview shows an error message to notify the user that this happened. To debug problems with remote stylesheets, use the DevTools available for the JCEF preview. Looking at the console or network tab reveals the full errormessage why a remote stylesheet wasn’t loaded. This adds additional styles and HTML headers in addition to the default stylesheet. The chapter “Docinfo Files” in the Asciidoctor User Manual provides more information about this capability. The contents will be embedded in the preview, therefore, relative links to the local file system will not work. Attribute substitution is supported in plugin version 0.31.35+. To prevent an infinite recursion, substitution is limited to 100 attributes and 20 substitutions per attribute. Follow these steps to enable Docinfo Files: Create a file .asciidoctorconfig with the following contents: .asciidoctorconfig :docinfodir: {asciidoctorconfigdir}/.asciidoctor (1) :docinfo: shared (2) 1 Point to a directory with docinfo files. As this uses {asciidoctorconfigdir}, the folder is relative to the .asciidoctorconfig file. 2 Tell the renderer to include the shared docinfo file docinfo.html.

JetBrains published Qodana that wraps the smart features of IntelliJ into a container, so it can be used on the command line as a Docker container. To make this simpler to use, it has been wrapped as a GitHub action. For AsciiDoc files, it will highlight all the problems that are highlighted in the IDE as well, including broken links (with the help of the AsciiDoc plugin) as well as grammar errors (with the help of the Grazie and Grazie Professional plugins). Figure 1. Overview Qodana process The process is as follows: Read all or parts of the project’s sources. This can be source code in any programming language or documentation like AsciiDoc. Process the files like with all the inspections known from IntelliJ. Users can add plugins from the Marketplace like in their IDE to support the languages they need. Generate a report as HTML to be used in a browser, as well as a SARIF report that can be processed by GitHub Code Scanning or other subsequent steps in the CI/CD pipeline. See below for an HTML report that Qodana generates. With the GitHub Action setup below, it will be attached as a ZIP file to workflow run instance. Figure 2. Qodana report with AsciiDoc inspection warnings The CI/CD process can publish the HTML report to a webserver so users can access it. In the example below, the GitHub action pushes the latest report to the GitHub pages of the AsciiDoc plugin project. See below for a screenshot of an annotated GitHub pull request. Using the SARIF integration, GitHub can compare the pull request with the base branch and will show only new problems introduced by the pull request. These examples show AsciiDoc syntax errors as examples. This setup shows Grammar in the same way. Figure 3.

When users write AsciiDoc content in the editor, the IDE will highlight problems in the editor. Different plugins will show different warnings: AsciiDoc Plugin: shows, for example, broken images and deprecated syntax. Grazie and Grazie Professional plugins: show spelling, style and grammar problems. To review problems in all files or a subset of files in a project, the IDE offers the functionality Inspect Code. The following paragraph provides the step-by-step instructions for this. As a pre-requisite when running grammar inspections in large projects, increase the memory of the IDE as the IDE might otherwise be slow, or stall due to the lack of memory. Choose menu item Help Change Memory Settings and change this, for example, to 4096 MB. Then follow these steps to validate files in a project. Use the icon to read the docs of the IDE to find out about additional functionality in each dialog. Select a folder in the project view with documents to inspect, for example, doc. Select the menu item Code Inspect Code…​. In the pop-up window, the directory is preselected. Keep this selection, or choose a different scope or the whole project depending on where files should be inspected. New in plugin version 0.37.55+: The plugin also adds two custom scopes: Project files without Symlinks, AsciiDoc files and AsciiDoc files without Symlinks, which are applied to the whole project. The scope without symlinks avoids validating a file multiple times with duplicate error messages. In this scope, it will only be validated once in its original location. While this avoids duplicate error messages, it might also hide error messages that are context dependent on the symlink location. When running this for the first time, select Configure…​ to select which kind of checks to run. To create a custom profile, use the gear-icon to duplicate the default inspection. For this example, after duplicating the default inspection, enter the name AsciiDoc and press Enter. Deselect all inspections except the AsciiDoc and Proofreading inspections to restrict the type of checks. Return here later to adjust the inspections to suit the project. After updates of IntelliJ or its plugins, revisit the profile to see if new inspections are available. Select OK to return to the previous pop-up. Select the AsciiDoc inspection profile and press Analyze. The IDE then shows a tool window with all problems found in the search. Depending on the size of the project and the inspections selected, the inspection might take some time.

Two different types of diagram renderer are supported: Asciidoctor Diagram and >. By default, the plugin uses the extension Asciidoctor Diagram that depends on locally installed tools to generate images (i.e. executables available in the PATH environment variable). The extension Asciidoctor Diagram renders the content of the editor, including all referenced includes, images and diagrams like PlantUML on the fly. As of the AsciiDoc Plugin version 0.31.14+, Asciidoctor Diagram is no longer included in the plugin as default as it adds approximately 15 MB to the download of the installation and each update. When the preview includes a diagram, the plugin shows an editor notification asking the user to download the necessary dependency. The download requires a working internet connection. When the download fails, the IDE prompts to check proxy settings or to retry the download. The IDE’s event log contains instructions for a manual download of the file. The dependencies will be cached locally. A new download will only be necessary when the AsciiDoc plugin requires a newer version. Users can force the download by selecting “Download AsciiDoc dependencies for diagrams and PDF creation” in the settings of the plugin. This is a folder that holds temporary files that are created, for example, for dynamic diagrams. When running in Asciidoctor’s UNSAFE mode, the plugin creates a temporary folder outside the project. When running in any other mode, Asciidoctor needs to have this folder them relative to the document’s folder. Diagrams in the preview when running in any mode other than UNSAFE will only work starting with version 0.33.8. To avoid checking in these files, consider adding a file path to the ignore file of your version control system. See below for a .gitignore file placed in the root of the project if the project uses Git as its version control system. .gitignore **/.asciidoctor/images/* **/.asciidoctor/diagram/* Alternatively, the plugin supports Kroki instead of Asciidoctor Diagram to render diagrams. Use the plugin’s settings to enable Kroki: When Kroki is enabled, the plugin sends the text diagrams to an instance of Kroki to display them as images in the preview. By default, it sends the diagrams to the free public cloud instance kroki.io, but users can install Kroki on their own infrastructure. Once the custom instance is set up, update the server URL in the plugin’s settings to point to it. In order for Kroki to embed diagrams in the PDF, the attribute allow-uri-read needs to be set in the plugin’s configuration. This allows Asciidoctor to retrieve the diagram and embed it in the PDF. Starting with plugin release 0.38.13 the attribute is set automatically once Kroki for diagrams has been enabled and the plugin is running in the default UNSAFE mode. When using the diagram option inline, users will need to set the attribute allow-uri-read in the plugin’s settings to allow the download of the diagrams at render time. As Kroki will in inline-mode fetch the diagrams synchronously while preparing the preview, a slow or unavailable internet connection to the user’s Kroki server can slow down or break the preview. To avoid this, consider using interactive for Kroki diagrams as an alternative. See Interactive vs inlined SVGs and Avoid flicker in preview on refresh for a discussion of tradeoffs. As an experimental option in plugin version 0.38.1+, there’s an embedded Mermaid support that is embedded in the plugin and will render Mermaid diagrams within the IDE without external helpers. To enable the support, toggle the checkbox Enable built-in Mermaid Diagrams support in the plugin’s settings. This is currently only supported for Mermaid diagrams, and only for the JCEF preview. JavaFX has a problem displaying SVG files correctly. Therefore, the plugin displays all diagrams in the JavaFX preview as PNGs even when the user specifies SVG as the diagram format. When using IntelliJ 2020.2+ and plugin version 0.31.25+, the JCEF preview will show diagrams as SVGs when the user specifies SVG as the diagram format. SVGs support interactions with the user such as hovering or links. This is only available when the user adds the option interactive or inline to diagrams or SVG images. Only when an SVG or diagram is inlined, the plugin will redirect clicks on links in the preview to local AsciiDoc files. See section “Taming SVGs” in the Asciidoctor manual. When using existing SVGs images in Asciidoctor, use opts=inline to inline existing SVGs When using Kroki, use opts=inline and set allow-uri-read in the plugin’s settings When using Asciidoctor Diagram, use svg-type=inline to inline generated SVG As this requires SVG support in the preview, this only works with the JCEF preview. The following PlantUML example renders a diagram in the preview showing a note “Link to class-demo.adoc” with a link. When the user clicks on the note, the plugin resolves the link class-demo.html to the workspace file class-demo.adoc. Source code for diagram // setting both opts and svg-type to make it work with both the Kroki plugin and the Asciidoctor Diagram plugin [plantuml,demo,svg,opts=\"inline\",svg-type=\"inline\"] ---- class Demo note right [[class-demo.html Link to class-demo.adoc]] end note ---- Figure 1. Diagram as displayed in the preview In this documentation the image above is non-interactive, as the target link of the note would not resolve. An extension with custom inline macro can create the links from an xref:[]. Use the JavaScript extension for example with Antora, and use the Ruby extension for IntelliJ as described in Asciidoctor Extensions. JavaScript extension to add a custom inline macro linkinpuml:...[] function register (registry, context) { registry.inlineMacro('linkinpuml', function () { this.matchFormat('short') this.positionalAttributes(['content']) this.process((parent, target, attrs) => { const anchor = parent.applySubstitutions(attrs.content, ['macros']) const [_, href, text] = anchor.match(/^]*>(.*)$/) const prefix = attrs.prefix return `[[${prefix ?

This is available from IntelliJ 2020.2+ and plugin version 0.31.x. Update to IntelliJ 2020.3+ for the best experience, as this fixes some limitations of earlier versions. The JCEF preview provides better HTML preview and additional features like scroll-to-view and opening links in the browser. As the preview is based on an up-to-date Google Chrome rendering engine, it offers in-par rendering compared to modern browsers. This includes rendering of fonts and SVGs. Once JCEF is available, the user can change the preview to JCEF in the plugin’s settings via File Settings…​ Languages & Frameworks AsciiDoc Preview Browser. If the user changes the Safe mode in the plugin’s settings from UNSAFE to any other mode, the preview in JCEF and JavaFX mode will restrict all content to the local project and will prohibit loading of external content using a content security policy (CSP). Starting with plugin version 0.36.6, all untrusted projects will default to the SECURE mode. The IDE shows a “Safe mode, limited functionality” notification once the user opens an AsciiDoc file. Activate the dev tools for the JCEF preview to debug issues where the preview doesn’t show content due to CSP. The following paragraphs describe problems where either a workaround is available or a fix is the latest version of IntelliJ or the AsciiDoc plugin. When using RDP to access the IDE, a user might not see the preview, and it appears as a blank space. This might be due to issue IDEA-299007. The root is that hardware acceleration is not available for the preview. As a workaround, set the registry option ide.browser.jcef.gpu.disable to true. The registry is available via menu Help Find action…​, then enter “Registry” to search the action, then choose “Registry…​”. In the dialog that opens, start typing the registry key given above to restrict the list. Check the checkbox on the right to enable this property. Press Close to close the dialog. Restart the IDE to apply the setting. When using tool windows in the undocked mode prior to plugin version 0.35.1, the preview will overlap with the tool window. See issue #751 for details. The JCEF preview doesn’t support the IntelliJ proxy configuration prior to 2021.1. Configuring a proxy for JCEF requires an IDE restart. Therefore, remote images in the preview might not show for users behind a proxy. See ‘Proxy issues with the JCEF preview’ for more information. Once a JCEF preview is open in a project, it now and then brings the focus to the project when editing files in a different window in IntelliJ 2020.2. This is fixed in the 2020.2.4 and 2020.3 release. See JetBrains issue “JCEF: steals focus from a different frame” for more information. On macOS there is no copy-and-paste from the JCEF preview in IntelliJ 2020.2. This is fixed in IntelliJ 2020.3 (see issues IDEA-241604 and asciidoctor-intellij-plugin/#322). As a workaround, open the preview in the browser by clicking on any of the browser symbols when hovering in the upper right corner of the editor and copying the contents of the browser window. JCEF preview is an embedded Chrome browser. After enabling the DevTools, users can right-click on the preview and use “Open DevTools”. This opens a fully equipped Chrome developer tools window that allows users to inspect the HTML created in the preview and to view the JavaScript console of the preview. In IntelliJ 2021.3.1+, closing the DevTools will also close the IDE. This is tracked in upstream issue IDEA-286008. Possible Workarounds: Enable “Confirm before existing the IDE” in the IDE’s settings. Once the DevTools have been closed for an editor, the editor needs to be closed and re-opened before DevTools can be opened again. Turn off registry option ide.browser.jcef.asciidocView.osr.enabled. With OSR turned off, the IDE doesn’t close any more on closing the DevTools; instead the preview goes blank once dev tools are closed (see IDEA-284130). Closing and re-opening the editor restores the preview. Once OSR is turned off, unpinned tool windows can no longer show above the preview (see IDEA-252845). For the AsciiDoc plugin 0.37.55+ Use the menu item Help Find Action…​ and choose “Open Devtools Window for the current AsciiDoc Preview”. Users can define their own shortcut in the Keymap settings entry for this action. For IntelliJ 2022.3 and later Set the registry key ide.browser.jcef.contextMenu.devTools.enabled to true and set ide.browser.jcef.asciidocView.osr.enabled to false to enable this feature. Once OSR is turned off, unpinned tool windows can no longer show above the preview (see IDEA-252845).

In the dialog that opens, start typing the registry key given above to restrict the list. Check the checkbox on the right to enable this property. Press Close to close the dialog. The DevTools are available for all newly opened editors. For editors already open, close and re-open them to see the DevTools. No IDE restart is required.

It will also enable additional diagnostic error messages like “Slow operations are prohibited on EDT” for all installed plugins. JCEF preview is only available from IntelliJ 2020.2+ and plugin version 0.31.x. It requires that the user runs on the pre-packaged JetBrains OpenJDK 11. This is recommended for Android Studio 4.2 and 2020.3+ that doesn’t ship with either JavaFX or JCEF support. Watch this issue in Android Studio’s issue tracker for progress. JavaFX preview that used to work with Android Studio 4.0 will not work with Android Studio 4.2 as it doesn’t package the necessary classes in the IDE. Therefore, follow these steps to enable JCEF preview for Android Studio. For Android Studio 2022.2+: Open menu item Help Find action…​ and search for “Choose Boot Java runtime for the IDE…​” Choose a runtime “17.0.x…​” labeled “JetBrains Runtime with JCEF” and install it. The IDE will restart. Go to the settings of the AsciiDoc plugin and check if the preview is set to “JCEF Browser”. Change it to “JCEF Browser” if this is not the case. For Android Studio 2021.1+: Open menu item Help Find action…​ and search for “Choose Boot Java runtime for the IDE…​” Choose a runtime “11.0.x…​” labeled “JetBrains Runtime with JCEF” and install it. The IDE will restart. Go to the settings of the AsciiDoc plugin and check if the preview is set to “JCEF Browser”. Change it to “JCEF Browser” if this is not the case. For Android Studio 4.2 and 2020.3+: Install the plugin “Choose Runtime”. Open menu item Help Find action…​ and search for “Choose Runtime…​” Choose a runtime \"jbrsdk-11_0_…​tar.gz\" or later and install it. The IDE will restart. Go to the settings of the AsciiDoc plugin and check if the preview is set to “JCEF Browser”. Change it to “JCEF Browser” if this is not the case.

Source highlighting in the preview works best when JCEF or JavaFX are selected in the plugin’s settings as the preview browser. Once a document contains a code block marked with a language that the source highlighter supports, the preview shows it highlighted. The default highlighter for the plugin’s preview is the CodeRay source highlighter. See Configuring Source Highlighters for how to set up source highlighting when rendering documents outside the plugin, and to change the source highlighting package to support other languages or different highlighters.

To activate source highlighting with CodeRay when rendering documents outside the IDE, set the following attribute in the header of the document: :source-highlighter: coderay While source highlighters are configurable and pluggable in Asciidoctor, the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ supports only a distinct number of source highlighters. The following lists the values for the source-highlighter attribute supported by this plugin. coderay The default highlighter for the plugin’s preview. See CodeRay source highlighter for more information. rouge An alternative highlighter. See Rouge source highlighter for more information. highlight.js A syntax highlighter based on JavaScript. The plugin supports also highlightjs as an alias for the name of the source highlighter. See highlight.js source highlighter for more information. Support for this highlighter is available since plugin version 0.32.50, earlier versions include only partial support. The plugin pre-bundles the common languages as listed on highlight.js' download page plus AsciiDoc. The plugin supports the attributes highlightjsdir, highlightjs-theme and highlightjs-languages. Attributes highlightjs-theme and highlightjs-languages are only supported when a highlightjsdir has been specified, and the necessary files are available. Valid values for the attribute highlightjsdir are: A URL starting with either http:// or https://, a local directory with an absolute path within the current project, or a relative directory from the project’s root folder. An example configuration for a local configuration could look like this: Configuration of highlight.js files in the local project :source-highlighter: highlight.js :highlightjsdir: hljs (1) :highlightjs-theme: default (2) :highlightjs-languages: basic (3) [source,basic] ---- 10 PRINT \"HELLO WORLD\" 20 GOTO 10 ---- 1 If the user specifies the attribute highlightjsdir, they must place the JavaScript bundle and a theme in the current project. For this example, the JavaScript bundle must be named /hljs/highlight.min.js. See the next item for the theme. 2 If the user specifies a highlightjsdir, they can override the highlighting theme using highlightjs-theme. A CSS file matching the selected theme must be placed in the current project. If a user does not specify highlightjs-theme, the default is github and the user must place the CSS file for the github theme in the styles folder. For this example, it must be named /hljs/styles/default.min.css. 3 If the user specifies a highlightjsdir, the user can specify additional languages for highlighting using highlightjs-languages. This requires a file for each language defined here. For this example, the user must place /hljs/languages/basic.min.js in the current project. Users can change the default code highlighter: To change this for all documents, configure attribute source-highlighter to the desired value in the plugin’s settings.

Lexing chops the input file into a stream of tokens. Each token has a type and a snippet of characters. The standard tool in IntelliJ is JFlex. The heart of lexing is asciidoc.flex. It defines multiple states, and uses a lot of functionalities and tweaking to parse AsciiDoc. Developers can add new token types in AsciiDocTokenTypes. Ensure to update the list TOKENS_TO_MERGE if consecutive identical types of the tokens should be merged. If the content of the token types should be spell-checked, add the token types to the list of tokens in AsciiDocSpellcheckingStrategy. Once the file changed asciidoc.flex, run gradlew compileJava to generate the parser code. A test suite for the lexer is in AsciiDocLexerTest. I recommend running it from the IDE. Each test case contains a doTest(...) method that parses one snippet of AsciiDoc and compares it to an expected “known good” result. A typical developer workflow for enhancing the lexer looks like this: Change asciidoc.flex in the IDE, adding new entries to AsciiDocTokenTypes as needed. Run gradlew compileJava on the command line. Add a test case to AsciiDocLexerTest and run it from the IDE. If lexing does not yet work as expected repeat from step 1. If lexing returns the expected result, update the expected parameter in the test. There is a ready-to-use run-configuration in Intellij called “AsciiDocLexerTest” that will re-generate the lexer and run the tests in one go. Things to consider when parsing AsciiDoc with JFlex: JFlex has originally been designed to parse Java code. AsciiDoc is different. There are no wrong characters in AsciiDoc. If you get the syntax wrong, the converter usually prints the wrong syntax “as is”. Only a matching set of for example asterisks (*) produces bold text. Here some JFlex rules for AsciiDoc together with an explanation: Look ahead rules Look ahead rules are considered slow in JFlex, but they give the power to recognize tokens only when there is a matching closing token. A slash (/) separates the matching pattern from the look ahead. Example of parsing typographic quotes {TYPOGRAPHIC_QUOTE_START} / [^\\n \\t] {WORD}* {TYPOGRAPHIC_QUOTE_END} End of line and end of file parsing JFlex supports $ to describe the end of a line as look-ahead. But this doesn’t work at the end of a file. To match the end of a file, the lexer uses the fact that JFlex will match the longest rule first (including any look-ahead rules). So first match the end of a line, then when not at the end of a line with the same length, and then the end of the file (the shortest rule). Example: matching a delimiter at the end of the file // delimiter at end of line {LISTING_BLOCK_DELIMITER} $ { /* ... */ } // delimiter not at end of line {LISTING_BLOCK_DELIMITER} / [^\\-\\n \\t] { /* ... */ } // delimiter at end of file (shorter match than the two above) {LISTING_BLOCK_DELIMITER} { /* ... */ } Stateful parser To parse bold, italic and monospace text (that can be nested) there is a set of boolean variables to memorize the current text style. They are reset at the end of a block, like in a regular AsciiDoc file. The function textFormat() uses them to determine the current token type from a combination of these flags. Other states memorize the length of block separator line to find the matching closing separator. Qualifying matches, push back and state change After a match the Java code checks additional conditions like if this is an unconstrained position in the stream. If the code decides to discard the match, two possible strategies out of several are: Push back all but the first character, and return the token type for the single character. As an example, when a double-asterisk occurs, but no bold text is to end here, see {DOUBLEMONO} in the lexer. Push back the complete text and continue with a different state using yybegin() (for example when matching a {HEADING_OLDSTYLE} in the MULTILINE state). Some expressions can be prefixed with a backslash (\\) to escape the expression. Use isEscaped() to check if it has been escaped. Unfortunately, the parser can’t continue with other matches in the same state. To work around this issue, blocks are parsed first in state MULTILINE, then in state SINGLELINE, and finally INSIDE_LINE to implement a hierarchy and some ordering of matches. Auto-completion Expressions described above match expressions once they have their closing syntax completed, and it is essential for the correct highlighting. To support autocomplete the matching must handle an expression where only the left part of the expression exists. A special case is in the parser to support autocompletion, as IntelliJ inserts a special string when parsing the content for autocompletion (named auto-complete in our parser). In the case for references (>) there are two rules, one for regular parsing and highlighting, one without: // regular {REFSTART} / [^>\\n]+ {REFEND} { yybegin(REF); return AsciiDocTokenTypes.REFSTART; } // auto-complete {REFSTART} / [^>\\n ]* {AUTOCOMPLETE} { yybegin(REFAUTO); return AsciiDocTokenTypes.REFSTART; } Highlighting is coloring the text in the editor. The file AsciiDocSyntaxHighlighter defines one TextAttributesKey to each entry in AsciiDocTokenTypes parsed during lexing. Currently, several tokens have the same highlighting ASCIIDOC_MARKER, so users have the same color for the pointy brackets around references (>)and markers for bold (*bold*). Once you add a new TextAttributesKey, you should either: reference an existing color (like ASCIIDOC_COMMENT references DefaultLanguageHighlighterColors.LINE_COMMENT) OR add a color the AsciiDoc themes AsciidocDefault.xml and AsciidocDarcula.xml Once you add a new token, you will need to add it to AsciiDocColorSettingsPage so users can customize the colors of their theme. This class references also SampleDocument.adoc and AsciiDocBundle.properties, therefore you’ll probably need to change these two files as well. Parsing gives a hierarchical structure and meaning to the tokens created in the parsing phase. It can define PsiElements inside the tree to allow interactions with the user like renaming of elements and autocompletion. The structure is the foundation of the structure outline view and the folding capabilities. The AsciiDocParserDefinition separates spaces and comments from functional tokens. It also serves as a factory for all PsiElements like AsciiDocSection for sections and AsciiDocBlock for blocks. AsciiDocParserImpl encodes the logic how to group the tokens to a tree. To do this, it has several strategies. This outline summarizes the most distinct strategies: References Once it sees the start token REFSTART (usually two opening pointy brackets, like >) return references. Examples for this are AsciiDocBlockMacro and AsciiDocRef. They all need to provide a Manipulator that IntelliJ calls when the user renames such a reference. To make the “Find References” functionality work, the tokens that contain the IDs need to be part of the Identifier-Token-Set in AsciiDocWordsScanner.

The central class and method to create AsciiDoc from HTML is AsciiDoc.render(). It is implemented as a singleton. It registers custom Asciidoctor extensions that are needed to improve the preview. It also enables custom extensions in the .asciidoctorconfig folder. There are three different preview implementations: JeditorHtmlPanel (for Swing) JavaFxHtmlPanel (for JavaFX) AsciiDocJCEFHtmlPanel (for JCEF, an embedded Chrome). The Swing preview will run on all JDKs and environments. It has very limited functionality as it doesn’t support JavaScript. Its capabilities to display HTML and CSS are limited. Therefore, the preview is not up-to-standards anymore. The JavaFX preview is the current default preview. It is available when the user is running 64bit JDK with JavaFX (the default JDK for JetBrains IDE). Starting with release 2020.2 JetBrains doesn’t ship JavaFX pre-bundled. Users can install the JavaFX for plugins on 64bit JREs to re-enable the JavaFX preview. The JCEF preview is available from IntelliJ 2020.2 onwards when running the IDE with JetBrains Runtime. The JavaFX and JCEF previews use HTML enriched with CSS and JavaScript. They use JavaScript to scroll the preview to the current position: once the user moves the cursor, the cursor line is transmitted to the preview using scrollToLine() and repositions the preview using JavaScript. When the user interacts with the JavaFX or JCEF preview (for example clicks on a text or a link), there is a bridge JavaPanelBridge back from JavaScript to Java to trigger actions like scrolling the editor or opening a link in the browser. Developers can log information from the JavaFX or JCEF preview the preview using: window.JavaPanelBridge.log(\"...\") This will call the method JavaPanelBridge#log, an inner class of JavaFxHtmlPanel for the JavaFX preview and myBrowserLog.addHandler for the JCEF preview.","title":"Rendering the preview","component":"contributors-guide","version":"","name":"preview","url":"/contributors-guide/coder/preview.html","titles":[{"text":"Rendering AsciiDoc to HTML","hash":"rendering-asciidoc-to-html","id":1},{"text":"Displaying the HTML as a preview","hash":"displaying-the-html-as-a-preview","id":2},{"text":"Debugging the preview","hash":"debugging-the-preview","id":3}]},"72":{"id":72,"text":"Update CHANGELOG.adoc with the latest changes for the release.

This guideline enables contributors to write in a style that is comprehensible for the reader. Don’t assume people are developers and have worked with IntelliJ before — this should be for writers or business analysts as well, and also for first-time IntelliJ users. Naming the actor, using the active voice and the present tense makes it easier for non-native speakers to understand this document. Adding the shortcuts should help users new to IntelliJ. Name the actor Examples: user, preview, editor, plugin Provide Keyboard shortcuts for different operating systems Example: [.windows]#kbd:[Alt+F7]# [.linux]#kbd:[Alt+Shift+7]# [.macos]#kbd:[⌥ F7]# displays as Alt+F7 (Windows) Alt+Shift+7 (Linux) ⌥ F7 (macOS) The UI theme displays an operating switcher which tries to auto-detect the operating system of the visitor, which will then show only the shortcuts relevant to the selected operating system. Therefore, always put all three operating systems into the docs. As per the Apple guidelines, there is no + but a space between the keys. Use active voice Active voice: “The preview displays the result” Passive voice: “The result is displayed” Use present tense Present tense: “The preview displays the result” Future tense: “The preview will display the result” Use only one capital letter for Keyboard shortcuts Consistent: Alt+7 Inconsistent: ALT+7 These conventions help writers find their way when they browse the documentation’s source code and lets them focus on the content. Writers can use the reformat functionality of the plugin using the shortcut Ctrl+Alt+L to apply these conventions. Each sentence should be on its own line in the AsciiDoc source This is the recommended best practice as it prevents re-flows due to reformatting and enables writers to move sentences and re-arrange paragraphs with less effort. This practice works best when writers enable word-wrap in their editor. Read more about this and other recommended practices on the Asciidoctor homepage.
