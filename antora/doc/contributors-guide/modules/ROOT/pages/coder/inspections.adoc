== How Inspections work

One example is the inspection that turns Markdown-styled headings into AsciiDoc styled headings.

An inspection contains the following elements:

* Inspection itself (`AsciiDocHeadingStyleInspection.java`).
* Registration of inspection in `plugin.xml`.
* Description (`AsciiDocHeadingStyle.html`).
* One or more quick-fixes (`AsciiDocConvertMarkdownHeading.java`).
* Test case (`AsciiDocHeadingStyleInspectionTest.java`).
* Test data fore before/after quickfix (`markdownHeading.adoc` and `markdownHeading-after.adoc`).
