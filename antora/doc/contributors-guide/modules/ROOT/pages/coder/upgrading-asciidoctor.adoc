{description}

== How to upgrade

Update `build.gradle` with the latest available AsciidoctorJ, AsciidoctorJ-PDF and AsciidoctorJ-Diagram release.

See the detailed comments in `build.gradle` for other places that need to be in line on every upgrade:

* The version of `snakeyaml` needs to be updated in line with JRuby that is a transitive dependency of AsciidoctorJ.
* The class `AsciiDocDownloaderUtil` holds the version numbers and SHA1 hashes of AsciidoctorJ-PDF and AsciidoctorJ-Diagram for a deferred download in the IDE.
