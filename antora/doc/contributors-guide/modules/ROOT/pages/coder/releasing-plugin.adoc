== Publishing a preview version

. Update _CHANGELOG.adoc_ with the latest changes for the release.
The first section heading after the heading "`Release Notes`" will be the version number of the release.
. Push all changes to GitHub and wait for the build-process to complete. +
GitHub actions create https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-intellij-plugin/releases[a draft release].
The plugin is attached as `asciidoctor-intellij-plugin-xx.xx.xx.zip`.
This file can be downloaded and installed manually as described in xref:user/installing-a-preview-release.adoc[].
. Edit the draft release.
. The tag version must not be changed, as it is already baked into the change log.
. Add a meaningful headline for the release.
. If there are any typos in the long description for the release, fix them in the changelog and wait for the build to update the draft release.
. The long description supports Markdown, while the changelog is written in AsciiDoc.
The syntax might need to be changed to make the content appear correctly in Markdown.
. Check the box "`This is a pre-release`".
. Publish the draft release in the GitHub Web UI+ The plugin will be available from the https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7391-asciidoc/versions[EAP (early access program) repository].
See _xref::user/add-eap-repository-to-ide.adoc[]_ for more information.

== Publishing a stable version

. Go to https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-intellij-plugin/releases[GitHub releases for this plugin]
. Edit the pre-release and uncheck the checkbox "`This is a pre-release`". +
A GitHub action will then publish the release.
Publishing of the stable version can start while the GitHub action publishing the preview version is still running.
. Due to caching in the JetBrains marketplace and the IDE, it might take some time (minutes to hours) for the IDE to pick up the new version.

[NOTE]
====
Every release must be published as a pre-release first, as users subscribed to the EAP channel will otherwise not receive this update.
