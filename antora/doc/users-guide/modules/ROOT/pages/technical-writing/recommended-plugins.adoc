== Prerequisites

This assumes that IntelliJ IDEA is already installed on the PC, a project is open and some first AsciiDoc content exists.
See xref:./installing-intellij.adoc[], xref:./opening-the-first-project.adoc[] and xref:./editing-an-asciidoc-file.adoc[] for details.

== Adding plugins to IntelliJ

A user can install additional plugins to add features to the IDE.
Each additional plugin will slightly increase the memory usage and startup time of the IDE, so there's always a small tradeoff.

Steps to install a plugin::
+
. Open the IDE's setting via menu:File[Settings...]. +
This opens the following menu:
+
.Settings menu when installing from JetBrains Marketplace
image::install-from-marketplace.png[Screenshot from settings menu when installing from JetBrains Marketplace]
. Select _Plugins_ from the settings tree
. Select _Marketplace_ tab if it is not selected yet
. Search for a plugin by its name, in this example 'asciidoc'.
. Click on the button btn:[Install].
. Once the download is complete, press the button btn:[Apply] and restart the IDE if there is a prompt to do so.

Sometimes 3rd party plugin might need some time to be available for the latest version of IntelliJ, so they might prevent a user from upgrading to the latest version of IntelliJ.
The plugins listed here are well-maintained and are usually available once a new version of IntelliJ is available.

If a plugin should suggested to other contributors to a plugin, consider adding it to the required plugins for the project and checking in that configuration to the repository.
See xref:./preparing-a-repository.adoc#specifying-required-plugins[Specifying required plugins] for details.

=== Advanced Terminal with clickable file names

In the Terminal tool window, IntelliJ offers a command line interface.

A command like [.linx.macos]#`ls`# [.windows]#`dir`# will show a list of files, but to open one of them the user would need to mark the text, copy it to the clipboard and paste it into a search field for search by file via [.windows.linux]#kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+N]# [.macos]#kbd:[⌘ ⇧ O]#.

To avoid the copy-and-paste of file names and to make the filenames clickable, install the plugin https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7677-awesome-console[Awesome Console].
It will also make URLs in the console clickable.

=== Advanced Grammar checking with Grazie Professional

The plugin Grazie already offers spell and grammar checking for several languages, and auto-detect the language of the text.
For IntelliJ it is installed by default, so no additional action is necessary for the user.

For additional grammar checking, and typing suggestions, there's the plugin https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/16136-grazie-professional[Grazie Professional].

include::partial$memory-requirements-grazie.adoc[]

It has built-in styleguides, and can be enhanced https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/16136-grazie-professional/docs/project-style-guides.html[by custom Vale rules on a per-project basis].

Read more in xref:features/advanced/grammar-checking.adoc[]

=== Adding additional languages with Hunspell

While the Grazie and Grazie Professional plugins support a range of languages, the list is still rather short.
At the time of writing this, Czech is, for example, missing.

The Hunspell community maintains a lot of freely available dictionaries.

The IntelliJ Spellchecker supports Hunspell dictionaries without an additional plugin.
Add the spell checker via menu:File[Settings,Editor,Spelling].

[NOTE]
====
* As of IntelliJ 2022.3, there the https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10275-hunspell[Hunspell plugin] is no longer needed for Hunspell support.
* The Czech dictionary in the JetBrains hunspell-dictionaries repo has a broken encoding at the time of writing.
Follow https://github.com/JetBrains/hunspell-dictionaries/pull/3[JetBrains/hunspell-dictionaries#3] for updates.
====

=== Additional status information about Git in the current repository

While IntelliJ includes standard support for Git, this plugin adds additional functionality like:

* In-editor notification of who is the latest editor of the current line.
* Status indicator in the lower right corner about changes

To add these functionalities, install the https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7499-gittoolbox[GitToolBox] plugin.
For additional information about the plugin, see the https://github.com/zielu/GitToolBox/wiki/Manual#commit-dialog-gitmoji-completion[GitToolBox plugin's manual].

[NOTE]
====
At the time of writing, this plugin is free.
In the near future, the author plans to offer additional features in a freemium model, meaning that users will need to pay to get functionality that exceeds the current functionality.
====

=== Accessing archive contents in the IDE

When a repository contains a ZIP or tar file or another archive format, IntelliJ's default installation can't show their contents in the IDE.

To access the contents of an archive like a regular folder, install the https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9491-archive-browser[Archive Browser] plugin.

=== Editing Diagrams as Code with PlantUML

The https://plantuml.com/[PlantUML project] supports different kinds of UML diagrams which can be edited and committed to a repository as plain text.

Those diagrams can be rendered in an AsciiDoc file using Asciidoctor Diagram or Kroki, see xref:features/preview/diagrams.adoc[] for more details.

To include such a diagram in AsciiDoc content, use an example like this:

[source,asciidoc]
-----
[plantuml]
----
\include::mydiagram.puml[]
----
-----

To edit such a file with the extension `.puml` with a preview window, install the https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7017-plantuml-integration[PlantUML diagram].

=== Editing Diagrams with diagrams.net in the IDE

The https://diagrams.net/[diagrams.net project] (previously known as draw.io) offers a what-you-see-is-what-you-get graphical editor for diagrams.
The files can be stored as XML, SVG or PNG.
The special feature of SVGs and PNGs is that they can be displayed in a browser without conversion, yet they are still editable with the diagrams.net editor.

To edit such a file in the IDE, install the https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/15635-diagrams-net-integration[Diagrams.net plugin].
While this plugin is still a very early version, it can support technical writers in managing their content.
