:description: How to search for keywords and named elements in an IntelliJ Project.

{description}

Searching content is used here to describe filtering content, for example, with a keyword.
Navigation is used to describe how to get from one AsciiDoc file to a referenced image or another AsciiDoc file.

== Prerequisites

This assumes that IntelliJ IDEA is open with a project with some existing content.
See xref:./opening-the-first-project.adoc[] and xref:./editing-an-asciidoc-file.adoc[] on how to do this.

== Searching within an AsciiDoc project

This describes several ways on how to search through the contents of a project, open the right files.
Use the menu item menu:Navigate[] for a full list of options, or use menu:Help[Find Action...] to search all action available in the IDE.

To return to previously edited files, use the following options:

--
* To return to a previous file, use [.windows.linux]#kbd:[Ctrl+E]# [.macos]#kbd:[⌘ E]# and select the file to return to.
* Use [.linux]#kbd:[Alt+Shift+Left]# [.windows]#kbd:[Alt+Ctrl+Left]# [.macos]#kbd:[⌘ ⌥ ←]# and [.linux]#kbd:[Alt+Shift+Right]# [.windows]#kbd:[Alt+Ctrl+Right]# [.macos]#kbd:[⌘ ⌥ →]# to move backwards and forwards in the latest cursor positions.
* To return to the previous editing position, use [.windows.linux]#kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+Backspace]# [.macos]#kbd:[⇧ ⌘ ⌫]#.

Search for a text snippet in the current file::

To search within the current file, use [.windows.linux]#kbd:[Ctrl+F]# [.macos]#kbd:[⌘ F]#.
This is by default case-insensitive and uses a plain text search.
Using the icons at the end of the input field, the use can switch to a case-sensitive search and a search with regular expressions.
+
If you want to replace instead of searching, you can use [.windows.linux]#kbd:[Ctrl+R]# [.macos]#kbd:[⌘ R]# instead.

Search for a text snippet across all files in a project::

To search within all files of the project, use [.windows.linux]#kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+F]# [.macos]#kbd:[⌘ ⇧ F]#.
+

+
This is by default case-insensitive and uses a plain text search.
Using the icons at the end of the input field, the use can switch to a case-sensitive search and a search with regular expressions.
+
Use the menu items menu:In Project[], menu:Module[], menu:Directory[] and menu:Scope[] to limit the search to a specific area.
+
Move the selection up and down, and use the small editor window to edit the code directly.
+
If you want to replace instead of searching, you can use [.windows.linux]#kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+R]# [.macos]#kbd:[⌘ ⇧ R]# instead.
+
Use btn:[Open in Find Window] to open the list of files in a tool window which allows opening each occurrence in an editor and then jump with [.windows.linux]#kbd:[Ctrl+Alt+Down]# [.macos]#kbd:[⌘ ⌥ ↓]# and [.windows.linux]#kbd:[Ctrl+Alt+Up]# [.macos]#kbd:[⌘ ⌥ ↑]# between them.

Search by File Name::

To search a file by its name, use [.windows.linux]#kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+N]# [.macos]#kbd:[⌘ ⇧ O]#.
+

+
Type parts of the path and the file name to restrict the search to the file.

Search Everywhere::

A user can search for all named elements in a project.
This includes attributes, IDs and section heading.
Use [.windows.linux]#2x kbd:[Shift]# [.macos]#2x kbd:[⇧]# to open the dialog.
+

To search for symbols only (which includes the AsciiDoc section headings, attribute names, etc.), jump there directly using [.windows.linux]#kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+N]# [.macos]#kbd:[⌘ ⇧ N]#.
