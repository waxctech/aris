:description: Learn about the AsciiDoc syntax in small training exercises.

The AsciiDoc Language reference documentation is the go-to-guide for writing AsciiDoc content.
{description}

include::partial$technical-writing-series.adoc[]

== Prerequisites

This assumes that IntelliJ IDEA is open with a project with some existing content.
See xref:./opening-the-first-project.adoc[] and xref:./editing-an-asciidoc-file.adoc[] on how to do this.

== Learning the AsciiDoc syntax with Kata

A kata is an exercise which focuses on learning something new.

The primary goals of this exercise are:

. Train the AsciiDoc syntax in several key areas.
. Learn how to use the https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/[AsciiDoc reference documentation].

To start the kata, check out the GitHub project https://github.com/ahus1/asciidoc-kata:

. Open the menu menu:File[New > Project from Version Control].
+

. As version control, choose menu:Git[].
. As URL, enter `++https://github.com/ahus1/asciidoc-kata++`.
. As Directory, enter an empty local folder.
. Choose the button btn:[Clone].

The repository contains several files with kata, with the first one named `01_formatting.adoc`.
Open the file, and it should show in the editor as seen below:

The block between the `====` markings on the left contains the instructions.
The same texts shows with a yellow background on the right in the preview.
It contains links to the AsciiDoc language documentation which contain information to find a solution for the exercise.
Click on the blue links in the preview to open them in the system browser.

At the end, indicated with tree dots (`++...++`), start typing the solution.
Use the preview on the right to verify that the AsciiDoc content entered on the left renders the expected results.

After this first exercise, pick other exercises which are relevant to your day-to-day projects.

== Variants of the exercise

Instead of practicing the AsciiDoc syntax alone, learners can team up with a second person to solve these exercises.

There's also a collaborative web editor which has been designed for such a training.
See this https://www.ahus1.de/post/interactive-asciidoc-training[blog post] for details on how to run such a training event.
