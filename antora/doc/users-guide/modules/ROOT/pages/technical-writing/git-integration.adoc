== Prerequisites

This assumes that IntelliJ IDEA is already installed on the PC and is started and that the reader is familiar with editing content in IntelliJ.
See xref:./installing-intellij.adoc[] and xref:./editing-an-asciidoc-file.adoc[] on how to do this.

In order for the Git functionality in IntelliJ to work, the user needs to install a Git client.

== Accessing Git from the IntelliJ GUI

This paragraph assumes that the user wants to use IntelliJ's integrated Git functionality.
To use the Git command line, choose the "`Terminal`" toolbox tab in IntelliJ to interact with the command line instead of following these steps.

The following example assumes that:

* The project is a checked-out remote repository.
* The local repository has a remote "`upstream`" with points to the main repository where people collaborate around a branch "`main`".
* The local repository has a remote "`origin`" with points to a clone of the main repository where the user wants to create a branch from where they want to create a pull request later.
+ The currently checked out branch in the local repository is "`main`" and points to the remote "`origin`".

=== Overview of the controls and tool windows

image::technical-writing/intellij-git.png[]

. Git tool window, click on "`Git`" to show and hide the window.

. With the "`Log`" tab active, it shows local and (if available) remote branches, plus the commits in the repository.

. In the menu:Branch[] dropdown, select _HEAD_ to show only the commits of the current branch.

. The "`Commit`" tool window shows all local changes that can then be committed.
Open it by click on the tool window or use the shortcut [.windows.linux]#kbd:[Alt+0]# [.macos]#kbd:[⌘ 0]#.
Explore the different actions in the toolbar by hovering with the mouse over the different icons.
+
Double-click on a highlighted file or press [.windows.linux]#kbd:[Ctrl+D]# [.macos]#kbd:[⌘ D]# to show the differences side-by-side. See the IntelliJ documentation on how to https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/comparing-file-versions.html[Compare file and folder versions].

=== Resolving merge conflicts

There's a chapter how to resolve merge conflicts with Git in the IntelliJ docs called https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/resolving-conflicts.html#distributed-version-control-systems[Resolve conflicts in Distributed Version Control Systems].

When a merge conflict occurs, it is usually good to start with menu:Apply non-conflicting changes[] first, either with the menu:All[] option or the magic wand icon image:technical-writing/magicResolveToolbar.svg[].

For a walk-though of handling a conflict with Git, watch the 5:34 min video https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/resolving-conflicts.html#resolve-conflicts-productivity-tips[at the end of the IntelliJ manual page resolving conflicts].

=== Learning more about Git functionality

* See the topic on https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/using-git-integration.html[Git] and its subchapters in the IntelliJ documentation
* Use menu:Help[Learn IDE Features] and choose the next final section "`Git`" to start the tutorial covering Git.
