== Prerequisites

This assumes that IntelliJ IDEA is already installed on the PC.
See xref:./installing-intellij.adoc[] on how to do this.

== First setup steps of the IDE

When starting the IDE for the first time, this is the start screen:

This screen allows technical writers to

* Opening a new or existing project

* Customizing the IDE

* Installing Plugins

* Start a tutorial to learn an IntelliJ IDEA

Users find a short introduction video in the online help for IntelliJ IDEA in chapter https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/run-for-the-first-time.html[Run IntelliJ IDEA for the first time].

Once the user opened their first project, IntelliJ IDEA will skip this screen and load the previous project.
Users can return to this screen by choosing the menu item menu:File[Close Project] until no project is open.
Then this screen appears again.

Use the following sections to configure the IDE before opening the first project.

=== Installing Plugins

This dialog allows installing plugins from the JetBrains marketplace.
To install the AsciiDoc plugin, choose the tab menu:Marketplace[], type _AsciiDoc_ in the search field, and choose the AsciiDoc plugin.
Press the button btn:[Install] to install the plugin.

If a user wants to install, uninstall or disable plugins later, https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/managing-plugins.html[they can do this via the IDE's settings].

=== Optional: Customize the IDE

The customize screen allows users to choose the color theme.
While dark mode ("`Darcula`") is the default, users can choose a light or high contrast mode.

All future dialogs in this guide use the IntelliJ light theme.

If a user wants to change this later, https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/user-interface-themes.html[this can be changed in the IDE's settings].

=== Optional: Start a tutorial to learn an IntelliJ IDEA

The button btn:[Start Learning] starts a tutorial that explains the IDEs features.

Most chapters of the tutorial use Java code to explain how the editor, auto-completion and refactoring works.
While the tutorial is about Java, most keyboard shortcuts and functionality will work similarly for AsciiDoc due to the installed AsciiDoc plugin.

The last chapter that explains Git is based on a YAML file and could be helpful to technical writers not yet familiar with Git.
