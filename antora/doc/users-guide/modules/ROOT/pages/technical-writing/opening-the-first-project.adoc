== Prerequisites

This assumes that IntelliJ IDEA is already installed on the PC and is started.
See xref:./installing-intellij.adoc[] and xref:./starting-intellij-first-time.adoc[] on how to do this.

== Opening a project

A project is usually either a single folder on the local disk, or a remote Git repository.
While a project can xref:features/advanced/multimodule.adoc[consist of multiple local folders], this is an advanced case which is possible but not recommended for users new to IntelliJ.

This dialog shows the startup screen when IntelliJ is started for the first time.

In this dialog, the user has the following options:

New Project:: Choose a name and a local folder where to create the project.
For a technical writing project, choose the menu entry menu:Empty Project[] to avoid creating unnecessary build scripts.

Open:: Choose a folder on the local disk to open it as a project.
Usually, this is the root folder of a previously checked-out Git repository.
If the project contains a lot of files, it might help to open only a sub-folder with the documentation.

Get from VCS::
Specify a URL with the remote repository and an empty local folder where to check out the files.

Once the step is complete, IntelliJ opens the project in the IDE view.

Assuming the user chose to create an empty project with the name "`helloworld`", the result will look similar to the following.

IntelliJ IDEA can open multiple projects concurrently.
To open another project, choose the menu entry menu:File[New] to see the same three options like on the start screen.

To return to the start view, the user chooses the menu entry menu:File[Close Project].
This view will then contain a list of previously opened projects.
The buttons for a new project, to open a folder and to get sources from VCS are in the upper row (smaller, and still with the same name as before).

The same options are also available when a project is open from the menu via menu:File[New,Project...], menu:Project from Existing Sources...[] and menu:Project from Version Control...[].

When using the menu menu:File[Exit] instead of menu:File[Close Project], the IDE exists directly.
When started again, it restores the previously open projects.
To return to the start screen, use menu:File[Close Project].
