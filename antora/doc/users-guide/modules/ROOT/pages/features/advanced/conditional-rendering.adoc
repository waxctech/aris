:navtitle: Conditional Rendering

{description}

== Situation

A user wants to show or hide paragraphs within a document when it is previewed in the IDE.

== Solution

IntelliJ sets the variables _env-idea_ and _env_ so that the user can render the texts differently when working with the Asciidoc plugin.

The plugin sets the variable _env-idea_ to _defined_, therefore the following works:

[source,asciidoc]
----
\ifndef::env-idea[]
Render this text WHEN NOT running IntelliJ Asciidoctor Plugin.
\endif::[]

\ifdef::env-idea[]
Render this text IF running IntelliJ Asciidoctor Plugin.
\endif::[]
----

The plugin sets the variable _env_ to the value _idea_, therefore the following works:

[source,asciidoc]
----
\ifeval::[{env}!=idea]
render this text WHEN NOT running IntelliJ Asciidoctor Plugin
\endif::[]

\ifeval::[{env}==idea]
render this text IF running IntelliJ Asciidoctor Plugin
\endif::[]
----
