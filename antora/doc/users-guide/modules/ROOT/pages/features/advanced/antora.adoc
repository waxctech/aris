= Working with Antora
:description: This plugin supports Antora attributes like 'imagesdir' and 'examplesdir'. It also resolves xrefs and includes in the preview.

https://antora.org/[Antora] helps to write and publish documentation websites.
It allows combining documentation from multiple repositories into a single website.

Each documentation component contains an `antora.yml` file https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/standard-directories/[with a common directory structure] with meta information about that component.

== Pre-Requisites

Users need to upgrade to version 0.30.31 or later of the plugin.
Initial support has been added in issue https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-intellij-plugin/issues/373[#373].

Auto-complete in `antora.yml` files was implemented starting with plugin version 0.32.54.

== Detection of Antora

The plugin will activate Antora support once it finds a file `antora.yml` and a sub-folder `modules`.
Antora will be active for all AsciiDoc files located in folders below such a file.
Once the plugin detects Antora, it activates its Antora features.

The plugin detects Antora playbooks by their name.
The filename `antora-playbook.yml` would be detected as an Antora playbook, as well as any other file that ends with `.yml` and contains both words `antora` and `playbook`.
For example, `antora-playbook-author.yml` would be treated as an Antora playbook as well, while `antora-localpreview.yml` would not be treated as an Antora playbook.

== Support provided by the plugin

=== Antora stylesheet for the preview

Once the plugin detects that a page is part of an Antora module, it uses the Antora CSS theme for the preview (starting with plugin version 0.37.7).
The preview will be in light or dark mode as configured in the plugin's settings.

To configure an individual stylesheet from a remote site, users should create an `.asciidoctorconfig` file like the following in the root or documentation folder of their project:

[source,asciidoc]
----
:linkcss:
:stylesdir: https://docs.mysite.com/_/css/
:stylesheet: site.css
----

If the remote stylesheet is not available due to an unreachable server or a missing stylesheet, the preview will default to the standard stylesheet.

For more information see the chapter xref::features/advanced/stylesheets.adoc[] for details.

=== Antora references support

When using the Antora xref macro like `+xref:version@component:module:page.adoc[]+`, the plugin will resolve links to the specific version, component and module with in the current projects.
For this it searches all available `antora.yml` files in the current project.

For `include::[]` macros the plugin supports the Antora families like `partial$`, `example$` and `page$`.

[NOTE]
====
Using Antora page families and includes works in the preview only for trusted project and when IDE is running in the default UNSAFE mode.
Otherwise, Asciidoctor will not be able to include files outside the document's root folder.
====

The plugin validates all references to files within the same component, and also across components.

=== Antora component and module name validation

[NOTE]
====
Validation of component and module names requires plugin version 0.37.23 or later.
====

The plugin validates the referenced component and module names.
If they don't exist, it will highlight this as an error in the editor window.

If a reference includes a version, the module name is only validated if the version and the component exist within the current project.
If they don't exist, it skips this reference for validation, as the plugin assumes this component to exist in a different branch that isn't checked out in the current project.

For this to work, all components of the Antora site need to be opened in one IntelliJ project.
If this isn't suitable in a given setup, suppress the inspection for a given reference, or disable the inspection in the IDE's setting for the given project.

To learn more about how to bundle multiple Git repositories as one IntelliJ project, see the chapter on xref:features/advanced/multimodule.adoc[multi-module projects] for details.

=== Antora editor support

In the editor, the user can autocomplete filenames and references using [.windows.linux]#kbd:[Ctrl+Space]# [.macos]#kbd:[^ Space]# and can navigate to a folder or file using [.windows.linux]#kbd:[Ctrl+B]# [.macos]#kbd:[âŒ˜ B]#.

To allow auto-completion for components that reside in different Git repositories, consider using a xref:features/advanced/multimodule.adoc[multi-module project].

=== Antora YAML schema support

When editing a component descriptor (`antora.yml`) or playbook (`antora-playbook.yml`), the plugin provides JSON-Schema support for validation, auto-completion and documentation.
Press kbd:[Ctrl+Q] for quick help on each attribute.

For the keys _nav_ and _start_page_ in `antora.yml`, the plugin provides auto-completion.

=== Antora preview support

The preview renders images, includes and links.
It also resolves https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/page/reftext-and-navtitle/[reftext and navtitle in the preview^] (new in Antora 2.3).
The user can click on links in the preview that will then open in the editor if they link to a local Antora page.

Users can customize the styling of the preview by referencing a stylesheet.
See section _xref:features/advanced/stylesheets.adoc#remote-stylesheet[Using a remote stylesheet]_ for details.

=== Antora attributes support

The plugin reads all attributes defined in the module's `antora.yml` file's _asciidoc.attributes_ section and uses this for the preview and auto-completion.

Starting with release 0.35.2 of the plugin, it also picks up attributes from an Antora playbook if this is within the same project.
If the playbook and the components are in different Git repositories, this requires a xref:features/advanced/multimodule.adoc[multi-module project].

The plugin sets multiple attributes to allow referencing files with the current Antora module:

imagesdir:: pointing to `images` of the current module (or `assets/images`, the Antora pre-2.1 style if that folder exists)

partialsdir:: pointing to `partials` of the current module (or `pages/_partials`, the Antora pre-1.1 style if that folder exists)

attachmentsdir:: pointing to `attachments` of the current module (or `assets/attachments`, the Antora pre-2.1 style if that folder exists)

examplesdir:: pointing to `examples` of the current module

page-*:: These and several other intrinsic attributes are supported for the preview like `page-component-version`, `page-module` etc.

Any of these attributes is set only if the directory exists.
While `imagesdir` and `attachmentsdir` use a relative path so that they work best with image and link macros, `examplesdir` and `partialsdir` use an absolute path that works best with includes macros.

=== Antora Collector Extension support

[NOTE]
====
This is new in plugin version 0.38.6.

Follow https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-intellij-plugin/issues/1177[asciidoctor/asciidoctor-intellij-plugin#1177] for updates on this feature.
====

The https://gitlab.com/antora/antora-collector-extension[Antora Collector Extension] allows content that is not checked into a Git repository to be used as a source for an Antora generated site.
The generated content has a higher priority than the checked-in content, so that it overrides and existing content at build-time.
When the command generates an `antora.yml` file in the root folder the scanned directory, those properties overwrite the properties in the component descriptor.

From a writer's point of view, the following features are supported:

* Attributes and other information from a generated `antora.yml` file overwrites the component's `antora.yml` settings.

* Generated resources like pages, partials and images are available for auto-completion and validation.
Filtering generated contents via the property <<scan-files>>  is not supported, yet.

This table displays which properties are supported by the plugin:

[cols="1a,1a,4a",]
|===
|Property | Supported? | Comment

| `run.*`
| no
| The plugin won't run the generators. Writers should run them from the command line as and when needed.

| `scan.dir`
| yes
| The directory with the contents generated by the `run` command.

| `scan.base`
| yes
| The folder where the plugin places the contents of the scanned directory.

|
[[scan-files,`scan.files`]] `scan.files`
| no
| At the moment, the plugin will scan files in the `scan.dir` folder.
A future version of the plugin will support this. Follow the GitHub issue https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-intellij-plugin/issues/1177[asciidoctor/asciidoctor-intellij-plugin#1177] for details.
