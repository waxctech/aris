= Working with Hugo
:description: The AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ plugin supports Hugo sites.

https://gohugo.io/[Hugo] is a static site generator.
The AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ recognizes Hugo projects and will adjust accordingly.

Images in the static resources can be referenced with an absolute target.
xref:features/advanced/frontmatter.adoc[] on a content page will be hidden from the preview.

NOTE: Support for static resources was added in plugin version 0.37.41.

== Pre-Requisites

A project needs to have the following features for the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ to recognize it as a Hugo project:

* A configuration file (`config.toml`, `config.json` or `config.yaml`) or configuration folder (`config`).
* A folder `content` next to the configuration file or folder.
* If a folder for static resources exists, it has to have the name `static` and needs to be next to the configuration file or folder.

ðŸ“’hugo_project

â”œâ”€ðŸ“‚ static
â”‚ â””â”€ðŸ“„ ...
â””â”€ðŸ“‚ content
  â””â”€ðŸ“„ ...
----


While Hugo's configuration file allows changing the name of the content and the static resource folders, this is not supported by the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, yet.

== Using images in content files

Images in the content can be page resources or static resource files.

Static resources are located in the folder `static`.

https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-resources/[Page resources] exist in the folder with the name of the page, with the content itself being named `index.adoc`.

ðŸ“’hugo_project
â”œâ”€ðŸ“„ config.toml
â”œâ”€ðŸ“‚ static
â”‚ â””â”€ðŸ“‚ images
â”‚   â””â”€ðŸ“„ image-in-static.png
â””â”€ðŸ“‚ content
  â”œâ”€ðŸ“‚ post-1-with-page-resources
  â”‚ â”œâ”€ðŸ“„ index.adoc
  â”‚ â””â”€ðŸ“„ image-for-post.png
  â””â”€ðŸ“„ post-2-without-page-resources.adoc
----

To reference an image in the post's folder, use a relative target name for the image.
To reference an image in the static resources, use a target name for the image starting with a slash (`/`).
