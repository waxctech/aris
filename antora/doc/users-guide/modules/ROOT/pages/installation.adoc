For users already familiar with JetBrains IntelliJ, there's a xref:quick-start.adoc[] documentation.
For those new to IntelliJ, there is a xref:technical-writing/index.adoc[] with a step-by-step-guide installing IntelliJ for technical writing.

[#prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

To use this plugin, the user of the plugin needs to have one of the IntelliJ family of IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA, GoLand, WebStorm or PyCharm installed.
See below for <<google-android-studio,Android Studio>> and <<intellij-mps,IntelliJ MPS>>.

All default download packages include the JetBrains Runtime 11, a pre-bundled OpenJDK runtime environment.
Please use the pre-bundled JetBrains Runtime to run the IDE as it proves to be the most stable.

Up to and including IntelliJ IDEA 2020.1 the pre-bundled OpenJDK includes JavaFX, which is required for a rich preview in 2020.1 and earlier.

From IntelliJ 2020.2 onward the plugin supports the JCEF browser preview that is pre-bundled in the JetBrains runtime that pre-bundled with 2020.2 and later.
It uses an embedded Chrome browser with up-to-date JavaScript and CSS handling.

If you've already installed the IDE and the plugin, continue to section xref:features.adoc[].

If you have the IDE installed already, continue to the next section <<installplugin>>.

If you are looking for a free version of the IDE, choose IntelliJ IDEA Community edition.
All other IDEs require a paid subscription.
You can still download them and use them with a free, time-limited evaluation subscription.

You can download them from the JetBrains homepage: link:https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/[^]

[#google-android-studio]
=== Google Android Studio

If you use Android Studio, go ahead and <<installplugin,install the plugin>>.

Afterwards:
include::partial$android-studio-next-steps.adoc[]

[#intellij-mps]
=== IntelliJ MPS

If you use MPS, go ahead and <<installplugin,install the plugin>>.

Support will be limited as MPS doesn't have all the APIs the plugin can hook into.
Have a look at xref:faq/troubleshooting-mps.adoc[].
Please open an issue on GitHub if you want to contribute to making MPS support better.

=== More information on JDKs

To use the JavaFX preview instead of the Swing preview, you'll need to run IntelliJ with 64bit Java and JavaFX installed.
Starting with IntelliJ 2020.3, the JetBrains platform requires JDK 11 to run.
Oracle JDK installations include JavaFX, but can make the IDE unstable and crash.
OpenJDK included in a Linux distribution usually doesn't include JavaFX.

The event more advanced JCEF preview will only work with JetBrains OpenJDK runtime.

Therefore, JetBrains OpenJDK pre-bundled with your IDE is recommended.

Read more about choosing the JDK version of the IDE in the JetBrains knowledge base entry "`https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/articles/206544879-Selecting-the-JDK-version-the-IDE-will-run-under[Selecting the JDK version the IDE will run under]`".
