An AsciiDoc recommended practice is to have link:https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-recommended-practices/[_one sentence per line_].
This can lead to lines larger than the editor's width.

Using soft wraps will make the content readable in the editor, as each line wraps at the width of the editor.

Go to menu:File[Settings... > Editor > General > Soft Wraps] and enable soft wrap for the file extension you use for AsciiDoc files (usually *.adoc).
